taoist;Taoist;x
taoist_DESC;Taoism is a polytheistic religion originating in China. While traditionally regarded as founded by Laozi the Supreme Old Lord in the 4th century BC, some elements and practices can be traced to prehistoric folk religions across the Middle Kingdom. The followers revere Tao, the underlying natural order of the Universe  the active expression of Tao for an individual is Te, the inner virtue. Taoists also value life over death, and believe it possible to achieve immortality, through various methods, including spiritual practices and alchemy. In the game, the strong focus on good governance within Taoist society means all Taoist characters get a bonus to Stewardship.;x

EVTDESC_JD_10013;One morning I wake up before my guards have attempted to rouse me. I hear excited chatter coming from the main hall, and as I open the [Root.GetChamberOpening] there is a bustle of servants filling the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. '[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the court of the [the_protector_general.GetTitle]!' they gossip.;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10013;And [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] comes bearing gifts? Excellent!;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10013_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is proud to bring souvenirs from the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName].\n;x
EVTDESC_JD_10014;'The [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] is a fascinating place, my [Root.GetLordLady]' [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] says, as I turn the foreign coins over in my hand. [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHeCap] arrived this morning, and besides the obvious souvenirs, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] comes carrying many a tale from [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels  everyone in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] wants to know everything.;x
#EVTOPTA_JD_10014;I shall have my scribes collect your stories.;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10014_TT;The journey of §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] was a success!\n;x
EVTDESC_JD_10015;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] returned to [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] late last night, seemingly exhausted from the journey. Today, during the briefing, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] simply appears relieved to be home again. Just as I begin to worry about the impression [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] must have made throughout [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] offers me a sealed letter of greeting from the [the_protector_general.GetTitle] [the_protector_general.GetHerselfHimself]!;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10015;Not a complete failure then!;x
#EVTOPTA_JD_10015_TT;§[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName]§!\n;x
EVTDESC_JD_10016;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName] has returned from [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels. When my council inquire about [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] impressions of the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] lets out an exasperated sigh. Then [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] unleashes a tirade about [adventurous_spirit.GetNegativeChineseConvoTopic].;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10016;This is not what I had hoped for...;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10016_TT;You lose a bit of grace.\n;x
EVTDESC_JD_10017;[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName] has finally returned from the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName]! However, when asked about [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] adventures, [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] just mutters, mostly about [adventurous_spirit.GetNegativeChineseConvoTopic].;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10017;I should have sent someone else in [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]'s stead.;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10017_TT;You lose some grace.\n;x
#EVTDESC_JD_10018;As [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName] has spent time in the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName], we discuss at length [adventurous_spirit.GetChineseConvoTopic].\n'I'd also like to introduce you to someone', [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] says, smiling.;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10018;Oh, how lovely! Welcome to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]!;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10018_TT;A [new_found_lover.GetManWoman] named §Y[new_found_lover.GetTitledName]§! joins your court.\n;x

EVTOPTB_JD_10018_TT;You gain some grace. §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is not pleased.\n;x
EVTDESC_JD_10019;There is something different about [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]  as we discuss [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] travels to the [the_protector_general.Offmap.GetFullName] [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] speaks passionately about [adventurous_spirit.GetChineseConvoTopic]. 'Oh, my [Root.GetLordLady]. You must let me go back', [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] pleads.;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019;If this is what you want...;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019_lunatic;What, you want to live there?!;x
EVTOPTA_JD_10019_imbecile;I'm not sure I follow...;x

EVTOPTB_JD_10019_TT;§Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! is not pleased.\n;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10019;Oh, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]. Surely, you don't mean that?;x
EVTOPTC_JD_10019_TT;You gain some grace. §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName]§! will get over it.\n;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10019;But... How can you ask me to send you away again, [adventurous_spirit.GetFirstName]?;x
EVTOPTD_JD_10019_TT;This option is available due to the high opinion §Y[adventurous_spirit.GetTitledName]§! has of you.\n\nYour [adventurous_spirit.GetRootRelation] bows [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] head in shame, assuring you that [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] will remain at court.\n;x
#EVTDESC_JD_10020;When I first did not hear anything from [adventurous_spirit.GetTitledFirstName], I simply assumed that [adventurous_spirit.GetSheHe] journey back home had been delayed. Sadly, I have now received word from [the_protector_general.GetTitledName] of [adventurous_spirit.GetHerHis] passing.;x
#EVTOPTA_JD_10020;The letter offers the condolences of [the_protector_general.GovernorTitle] [the_protector_general.GetTitledName].;x

EVTDESC_JD_50031_UNREST;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Popular uprisings have broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion] and large groups of disgruntled peasants have taken up arms, led by [GetRandomChineseFaction]. Trade has been halved along the Silk Road and China will not be able to defend its Tributary states.;x
#EVTDESC_JD_50031_FAMINE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. China has been suffering from droughts for several seasons and the people are starving as a Great Famine upsets the harmony in the Divine Land. The caravans and ships of the Silk Road have virtually ceased and the great Chinese artisans are simply trying to survive. China will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_PLAGUE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. The Pale Rider is sowing his deadly seeds in China - a Devastating Plague has broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion]. No goods travel along the Silk Road as the merchants fear infection. Even so, the deadly scourge is spreading quickly, and the troubles of China could soon be ours... China will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_MONGOLS;[offmap_china.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must be displeased with the Dragon Throne, for a great Mongol Horde has managed to cross the mighty fortifications of Northern China, intent on disrupting the harmony and prosperity of the 'Divine Land'. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName] is mustering [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] armies in [GetRandomChineseRegion] for a swift response, but [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] could be in for a long war...

EVTDESC_JD_50031_JURCHENS;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must have decided to punish the arrogance of the bureaucratic Chinese regime, for a great Jurchen Horde has recently disrupted the harmony of the 'Divine Land'. Led by their great Khagan, numberless fierce riders have crossed the Liao river and invaded Northeastern China, apparently intent on conquering the whole empire. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is slowly gathering [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] forces in [GetRandomChineseRegion], but many are already questioning whether [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] has lost the Mandate of Heaven...

EVTDESC_JD_50281_UNREST;The long period of Unrest and sporadic popular uprisings in China has turned into a full-blown Civil War! Many think that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is weak and has lost the Mandate of Heaven. Even as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] cowers in [GetRandomChineseRegion], massive rebel armies are on the move, attacking loyalist strongholds. Still, the rebels have not yet gathered under a single leader, and different factions are even fighting each other. Silk Road profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - China will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;x
EVTOPT_JD_50281;A House Divided...;x
