EVTDESC_MNM_7855_A;Night has fallen as I contemplate my latest ritual  there has to be more efficient ways of washing blood off one's clothes...?\n'You must be the [Root.GetDWDemon]', a voice sounds behind me. I spin, only to find a sinister young woman, casually raising a wooden stake. Then she shrugs. 'I can't let evil like you just walk around'.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_A_again;As I retire to my quarters for the night, I am startled by a shadow, suddenly moving. 'It's been a while', a bright voice muses as a woman steps into the light, weapon raised. 'How did you get into my [Root.GetCapitalHolding]?', I demand to know, but my voice betrays my brave act. 'Your guards are sleeping, my [Root.GetLordLady]... Let's finish this'.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7855_B;After having snuck out for a late walk with my pet familiar, I make my way back through the gates of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]. Suddenly, shadows surround me and I'm shoved into a wall. A group of angry villagers, their expressions dark in the light of their torches, has gathered around me. Someone yells: 'burn [Root.GetHerHim]!';x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_B_again;I am moving quietly through the gates into the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] tonight, grateful for my disguise. Specific rituals sometimes require me to blend in amongst the common folk. It's become almost second nature  my [GetDWPartyClothes] would be quite the giveaway!\n'There [Root.GetSheHe] is!' someone yells. 'BURN [Root.GetHerHim]!';x

EVTTITLE_MNM_7855_C_again;The Return of the Demon Hunters;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_C;Having just performed a ritual requiring the full moon, it's past midnight when I sneak back into my quarters. Satisfied, I begin washing the blood off my hands. Behind me, someone clears their throat. 'Not so fast, you evil [Root.GetDWDemon]'. I feel the tip of a sword in my back. Another voice mutters: 'Just kill it, brother'.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_C_again;In honor of [GetDWRandomDemon], I've just finished a new blood ward on my wall. The flickering candlelight makes the intricate pattern glisten, and I back away to admire my art. Suddenly, two shadows grow on the wall, looming over me... The tallest one says, nonchalantly: 'I told you we'd get another shot, brother'.;x
EVTTITLE_MNM_7855_D;The Demon Hunter;x
EVTTITLE_MNM_7855_D_again;The Return of the Demon Hunter;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_D;In the middle of one of our more carnal rituals, my fellow [Root.GetSocietyRank] suddenly gasps in surprise: 'Did you invite someone else?' Before I have time to reply, a torch is thrown to the floor, sparks singeing my skin. 'We've become [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s madmen, all of us', a darkly clad figure says. 'Die, you demon!';x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_D_again;I still have nightmares about the mysterious demon hunter I once encountered. These days, while I haven't been covering my tracks, the stench of my foul deeds travels further than ever before... Staring at the ceiling in my room, the moonlight suddenly goes out. Leaning over me is a man, weapon raised. 'We meet again'.;x
EVTTITLE_MNM_7855_E;An Affront to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];x
EVTTITLE_MNM_7855_E_again;Still an Affront to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_E;I'm not sure what my steward was thinking, letting in a group of holy knights to our [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. They know. Everyone knows! What I am, what I can do... When night falls, I'm not surprised to find myself backed into a dark alley, surrounded by them. 'All [GetDWDemons] must die...!', they cry, riling each other up.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7855_E_again;Out surveying my lands, accompanied by a small entourage of servants, I notice a huge cloud of dust being stirred up on the road up ahead... My servants begin to shout and scramble about, as we see a group of knights charging at us  their banner, clearly that of the demon hunting cohort I barely escaped before...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_7855;What is the meaning of this? By [GetDWDevil], I will fight you!;x

EVTOPTC_MNM_7855_C;Woah, woah... Let's be civilized... You seem like businessmen!;x

EVTDESC_MNM_1225_A;One of my hunting parties caught a great white boar today. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] must have sent us this creature, as it took ten men to bring the beast down, and the effect it has had on my soldiers is clearly the boon I have been waiting for. 'Bards are already composing songs, my [Root.GetLordLady]', a captain tells me.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1225_B;One of my hunting parties caught a great white boar today. I am told it took ten men to bring the beast down, and rumors of the effect it has had on my soldiers is already spreading through court.
