EVTDESC_MNM_6250_A;I have pondered my mission to train an apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination and I'm considering my own [assassin_protege_1.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHeCap] has been illustrating a steely determination in some matters, and I think [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe]'s more clever than [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe] lets on... It could be a dangerous path, but under my wing, perhaps [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe] could excel?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6250_B;A youngster has been caught red-handed trying to pickpocket me today. My guards are furious with the child, but noting the quiet defiance in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] eyes, I am reminded of myself. Remembering the mission assigned to me by the Assassins, I wonder if the child is as sly as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems – perhaps this incident could benefit us all?;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6250;I'll speak with [assassin_protege_1.GetTitledFirstName] about [assassin_protege_1.GetHerHis] potential.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_1.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6250;Maybe [assassin_protege_2.GetTitledFirstName] would be better suited for this...;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_2.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6250;Actually, [assassin_protege_3.GetTitledFirstName] is the best choice.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_3.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_6250;Let [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] go! I have a special interest in this lost soul.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_6252;Bolstered by my tutelage [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] is growing into a confident young [assassin_protege.GetBoyGirl]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] reads everything I throw at [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] and [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems eager to learn more about our beliefs... The next step for [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] should be chosen carefully.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] should focus on cultural adaption, for infiltration missions.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6252_TT;You will encourage the scheming skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] could probably use more practice with the dagger.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6252_TT;You will encourage the martial skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] needs to know balance in all [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] areas of expertise.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6252_TT;You will strive for a well-balanced training for §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_A;The rigorous training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to subtly befriending several foreign diplomats at court, [assassin_protege.GetTitledName] has been studying the books fervently, even in candlelit hours. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_B;The combat training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to having spent rigorous amounts of time in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] practice grounds, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] clearly outmatches any opponents [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] own age. I believe a test is in order.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_C;The rigorous schedule I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to demonstrating a knack for foreign languages, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] is proving increasingly proficient in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] combat training. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6253;I'll have my associates arrange some sort of test.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6253_TT;This outcome will be influenced by the various skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_A;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]. The reports state that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] somehow managed to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of it, convincing the attackers that they had the wrong target. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] then sent them on a wild goose-chase around the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], which I am told lasted hours.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_B;[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] expertly handled the surprise attack I planned out, striking the thugs down with frightening precision. When I explained that the men [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] had beaten, one even killed, had been working on my orders, [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] cocked an eyebrow at me before leaning back in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] chair, smiling.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_C;The hired thugs I sent to ambush [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] came back bruised and confused tonight. When I confront my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] calmly explains that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] made them see the error of their ways. "One will likely die from the injury", I say. [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] nods slowly, before returning to [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] book.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6254;You handled this well, [assassin_protege.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6254_TT;The Assassins will be pleased to hear of your protege, §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_A;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and managed to sneak into a building to hide. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] caused quite a ruckus as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] stumbled into the bedroom of a local merchant and his wife. The escape from there was hasty, but I suppose I'm not entirely disappointed in [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] surviving the ambush.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_B;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and eagerly drew [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] blade on them. The fight that ensued left both parties wounded, but at least [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] survived the ambush. I'll have to talk to [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] about the optimal points of attack on the human body, however.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_C;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] attempted to fool them by claiming my orders had changed, that the ambush was called off. While I am impressed that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] saw through the test, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] did not sell it completely, and instead ended up with running away in panic.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6255;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap]'s good, but [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] still has a lot to learn.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6255_TT;You believe in [assassin_protege.GetHerHim]. The Assassins will be informed of your apprentice, §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6256;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] night when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] apparently tried to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of the situation, but the attackers were not so easily charmed... They were not supposed to injure [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] badly, but something must have gone wrong.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6256;Oh, poor [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. I thought you had potential.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6256_TT;The life of an Assassin is not an easy one but it would seem §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§! was not ready for it. The Assassins will be informed of your failure.\n;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_6258;I'll scream it from the top of my lungs!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6258;I'll join the religion in secret.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_A;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has deeply impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that I should be proud to have been the guardian of this faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_B;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that they are pleased with my training of the faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_C;The death of my dear apprentice took me by surprise, but what is worse is the complete silence I have been met with from the Assassins. I can only assume that they are disappointed – all I can do is wait for a new mission.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_D;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that as soon as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] has agreed to convert to our faith, they will share in my pride as guardians of this remarkable young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_E;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order.

EVTDESC_MNM_7001_A;I'm having dinner and plenty of drinks with [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledName] tonight. It's lovely, yet what I am most charmed by is [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] [satanists_recruiter.GetHerselfHimself]. Why else would I not immediately stop our conversation, which has slowly begun to touch upon some almost heretical ideas, questioning the salvation of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;x
EVTOPTA_7001;If we do not ask questions, why did [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] make us curious?;x
EVTOPTA_7001_TT;You think it's a great discussion, fueled by alcohol or not.\n;x
EVTOPTB_7001;We should not speak of this, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTB_7001_TT;You would never question the authority of the almighty.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7002_A;Meeting with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName], I made sure to only cautiously question the absolute power of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] almighty [satanists_recruit.Religion.GetHighGodName]... Thankfully, it seems that my carefully chosen words had the desired effect on [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim]. From [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] glittering eyes I got the distinct impression that [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] enjoyed the philosophical aspect of our conversion.;x

Regretfully, it seems that my words only irritated my [satanists_recruit.GetRootRelation] – from the steely look [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] finally gave me, I should probably steer clear of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim] for now.;x
EVTOPTA_7002;A sensible [satanists_recruit.GetManWoman], [satanists_recruit.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_7002_TT;Continue your endeavor to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].\n;x

EVTOPTC_7002;Disappointing.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7003_A;Walking the palisades of my [Root.GetCapitalHolding] I am joined by [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]. I find myself agreeing with a lot of the concepts [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] presents – the futility of prayer particularly resonates with me. Suddenly, [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] turns to me and presses a small leather pouch into my hand. "My [Root.GetLordLady], will you carry this with you, for protection?";x
EVTOPTA_7003;I'll keep it hidden, and I thank you, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_7003_TT;You encourage the advances made by §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7004_A;I've arranged a run-in with [From.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetCapitalHolding] today. [From.GetHerHisCap] face lights up upon seeing me and we stay out talking for hours. I offer [From.GetHerHim] a protection spell, in a leather pouch – of course, I do not explain the content... Yet [From.GetSheHe] smiles, accepting the token.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7004_B;I've arranged a run-in with [From.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetCapitalHolding] today. [From.GetHerHisCap] face darkens when I again attempt to discuss my world views. I then offer [From.GetHerHim] my favorite protection spell, a chicken leg in a leather pouch – I thought it was harmless enough, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to accept the gift.;x
EVTOPTA_7004;[From.GetSheHeCap] just needs one more little push.;x
EVTOPTA_7004_TT;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].;x
EVTOPTB_7004;It's been interesting, but I don't think [From.GetSheHe] is ready for more.;x
EVTOPTC_7004;This has been a wasted effort – [From.GetFirstName] is locked in [From.GetHerHis] views.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7005;"What if I told you that all you have been taught to believe in is a lie?" [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] continues, throwing a cautious glance around us before pulling up [satanists_recruiter.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing a scar in the shape of a pentagram. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied to Adam in the Garden of Eden. Reject the Tyrant deity and let [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] guide your steps...";x
EVTOPTA_7005;You truly are a [satanists_recruiter.GetDWMagician] then? Can you [Root.GetDWReasonToJoin]?;x
EVTOPTA_7005_TT;You ask §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! how you can begin your journey into this forbidden knowledge.\n;x
EVTOPTB_7005;That is blasphemy, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName]! Leave my sight, before I call the guards!;x
EVTOPTB_7005_TT;You dismiss §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! offer and pretend it never happened.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7006;When I revealed the brand on my lower arm, expecting the final hook to sink in, [From.GetFirstName] staggered backwards in shock and made a hand gesture for protection. "That is blasphemy, [Root.GetFirstName]" [From.GetSheHe] said, eyes wide. "Leave my sight, before I call the guards!" [From.GetSheHe] called and it was with reluctance, albeit hastily, that I left.;x
EVTOPTA_7006;If I can't turn [From.GetHerHim], no one can.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7007;When I proceeded to reveal the brand on my lower arm, certain that the final hook would sink in, [From.GetFirstName] inhaled sharply, worrying me for a second. "You truly are a [Root.GetDWMagician] then", [From.GetSheHe] says, eager and relieved. "Can you help me [From.GetDWReasonToJoin]?" [From.GetSheHe] continues, eyes pleading.;x
EVTOPTA_7007;Patience, [From.GetSisterBrother]. We will speak more soon.;x
EVTOPTA_7007_TT;Write a letter to the coven about §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! induction. [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] §Y[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName]§! will handle it from here.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7008;"We might... If you offer yourself up to [satanists_recruiter.GetDWDevil], he will grant you powers [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has kept from us humans." Fingering the leather pouch in my pocket, I slowly nod. "Oh, and I think you'll enjoy it..." [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] said, with a knowing smile.;x
EVTOPTA_7008;If there is any chance it'll [Root.GetDWReasonToJoin], I will.;x
EVTOPTA_7008_TT;§Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! leaves you alone for now – the coven will be in contact with you.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_A;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been mulling over [satanists_recruiter.GetPossPronoun] words. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] told Adam he would die if he ate of the forbidden fruit... [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] lie.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_ALT;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been pondering what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] would think of me for venturing down this path, but [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] has already offered me more support than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] ever has. I have begun studying books on the occult and so far I'm finding the views preached at the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] to be narrow-minded, at best.;x
EVTOPTA_7009;Their lies are meant to hold us back!;x
EVTOPTA_7009_TT;You continue to await further instruction.\n;x
EVTOPTB_7009;I can't believe I have been so gullible.;x
EVTOPTC_7009;I am beginning to feel that I have been missing out...;x
EVTOPTD_7009;Why must we always put the needs of others before our own...?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7010_A;I found some cryptic scrawlings written in blood on my bedroom door this morning. The guards say they haven't seen anyone enter during the night and I dare not ask my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] to decipher it. Yet, I think I understand... The pentagram... the mark of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;x
EVTOPTA_7010;Of course, the bargain must be struck!;x
EVTOPTA_7010_TT_1;You carve a pentagram into your arm, just like the one §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! showed you.\n;x
EVTOPTA_7010_TT_2;You cut your into your arm, a star surrounded by a circle, a symbol from your forbidden studies.;x
EVTOPTB_7010;My immortal soul... What if I'm wrong?;x

EVTOPTA_7015;You're the messenger?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7016;The [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] smiles. "I'm pleased to find you not only a charming [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.GetFirstName], but also one capable of intellectual discourse. The brethren value the pursuit of knowledge, you see, in addition to more... earthly pursuits." [From.GetHerHisCap] smile turns into a predatory grin as [From.GetSheHe] continues: "We'll soon see exactly how committed you are...";x
EVTOPTA_7016;I... What do you need me to do?;x
EVTOPTA_7016_TT;§Y[satanists_inductor.GetTitledFirstName]§! offers no reply, instead taking you by the hand.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7017_A;[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] escorts me to my bedchamber. I hesitate upon entering, finding it flooded with light, as candles form a circle around my bed. Several hooded figures surround the room, chanting in unison. "Fear not, [Root.GetSisterBrother]. Power and pleasure – these are the gifts of [satanists_inductor.GetDWDevil].";x
EVTOPTA_7017;I like the sound of that!;x

"That is not an impossible wish, [Root.GetFirstName]. Are you ready to kill and, if He wills it, get killed to defend the words of His Prophet and the rightful heir?";x
EVTOPTA_6024;I am, [From.GetFirstName]. And you say there is a way?;x

EVTOPTB_6024_TOOLTIP;Dismiss §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! question and end the dinner.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6025;When I suggested there is a way for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [From.GetSheHe] only scoffed dismissively and changed the subject. Judging by the look [From.GetSheHe] gave me as I left, however, it seems as if [From.GetFirstName] is not so oblivious after all...;x
EVTOPTA_6025;[From.GetSheHeCap] is all grand words but lacks true courage. Disappointing.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6026;When I suggested there is a way for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [From.GetHerHis] eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope. "I am ready, [Root.GetFirstName]. Please, if it is true, will you set me on this path?";x
EVTOPTA_6026;Someone will get in touch with you shortly, [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_6026_TOOLTIP;Write a letter to the order about §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! induction. [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] §Y[assassins_inductor.GetFirstName]§! will handle it from here.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6027;"I do, [Root.GetFirstName]," says [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a solemn, almost ceremonial, voice. "There is an Order devoted to Allah and the rightful Caliph. One that defends those true of faith and bring vengeance to their persecutors. The Assassins are always in need of champions. Think it over, and someone might reach out...";x
EVTOPTA_6027;Me, an Assassin? Perhaps this is my destiny...;x
EVTOPTA_6027_TOOLTIP;Think things over while you wait for someone to get in touch.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6028;My eyes open, seeing only darkness. For a moment, my mind is blank, before the first thoughts get through the haze of sleep. Why did I wake up? A deep [Root.GetManWoman]'s voice cuts through the silence, startling me. "The time has come for you to profess your devoutness to Allah and the rightful imam Ali.";x
EVTOPTA_6028;Allahu akbar! Glory to Ali!;x
EVTOPTA_6028_TOOLTIP;Declare your devoutness to Allah and Ali.;x

EVTOPTD_6028;I... I'm not sure I have what it takes.;x
EVTOPTD_6028_TOOLTIP;Do not declare your devoutness.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6029;"Excellent." I turn my head towards the voice. A hooded figure steps out of the shadows by the [Root.GetChamberOpening] and a hand appears from underneath the cloak, holding out a piece of parchment. "Before we continue, you must sign this. A written pledge of allegiance to the Grand Master of the Assassins. A routine... safety measure.";x
EVTOPTA_6029;Of course. One moment, let me find a quill...;x
EVTOPTA_6029_TOOLTIP;Sign the pledge of allegiance.;x
EVTOPTB_6029;But this could be used against me!;x
EVTOPTB_6029_TOOLTIP;Refuse to sign the pledge of allegiance.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6030;As soon as I lift the tip of the quill from the parchment the hooded [Root.GetManWoman] snatches it from the desk. "The Grand Master will be pleased, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. You will receive an invitation to our stronghold, but for now, go back to bed. You will need the rest." The next moment, [Root.GetSheHe] is gone.;x
EVTOPTA_6030;Farewell... I suppose.;x
EVTOPTA_6030_TOOLTIP;Now all you can do is wait.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6033;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nYou are hereby invited to the Assassins stronghold in [inductor_rendezvous.County.GetName].

EVTDESC_MNM_6034;The journey to [inductor_rendezvous.GetName] was comfortable, however, the dwindling mountain path to the Assassins' stronghold was a torment to tread. As I finally arrive at the castle, my guide brings me to the main tower, where I am introduced to [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_6034;I am ready to serve, [From.GetSocietyRank].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6035;There is no time for pleasantries, not even a moment to catch my breath, before [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] leads me through another door, down a spiraling stone staircase. We descend in silence. The stair ends and the [From.GetSocietyRank] opens another door, revealing a gloomy basement room and a figure kneeling on the floor.;x
EVTOPTA_6035;Who... who is that?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_A;"This," [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [From.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman]'s head. It is [assassins_sacrifice.GetTitledFirstName], my [assassins_sacrifice.GetRootRelation]! The shock in [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim]." The [From.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_B;"This," [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [From.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [Root.GetManWoman]'s head. It is one of my servants! The chock in [Root.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [Root.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [Root.GetHerHim]." The [From.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;x
EVTOPTA_6036;If it is the Grand Master's wish.;x
EVTOPTA_6036_TOOLTIP;You kill the servant.;x
EVTOPTB_6036;I... I can't do this!;x
EVTOPTB_6036_TOOLTIP;You refuse and try to escape.\n;x
EVTOPTC_6036;I beg of you, let us go. I can pay you, I swear.;x
EVTOPTC_6036_TOOLTIP;Attempt to bribe §Y[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]§! into letting you and your intended victim go.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6037;The blood is still gushing from the infidel's limp body as I kneel in front of the [From.GetSocietyRank]. [From.GetSheHeCap] recites the oath of the Assassins and I repeat after [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] speaks the final words, inducting me into the order, [From.GetSheHe] smears the blood across my cheeks. "Stand up, Adherent [Root.GetFirstName]. Welcome to the Assassins.";x
EVTOPTA_6037;My life for Allah! Praised be the Assassins!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_A;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] I sink it into [From.GetHerHis] stomach. I free my intended victim and drag [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim] after me, up the stairs, without looking back once. You just keep running. By some miracle, no one intervenes.;x
EVTOPTA_6038;We might be safe for now, but for how long?;x
EVTOPTA_6038_TOOLTIP;You manage to escape from the assassins.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_B;I turn around and run. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s footsteps get closer behind me and as I reach the top of the stairs, [From.GetSheHe] grips a fistful of my mantle, pulling you down on top of [From.GetHerHis]. Vertigo. Crippling pain. Blind, manic frenzy. By some miracle, you manage to free yourself. You are alive. But for how much longer?;x
EVTOPTB_6038;They are... they are coming for me.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_C;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] I stab at [From.GetHerHim], without a moment's hesitation. The blade strikes only air. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves too quickly. I am on the floor, trapped under the weight of [From.GetHerHis] body. I plead for my life as [From.GetSheHe] wrestles the weapon from my hand.;x
EVTOPTC_6038;I... I panicked! Please! You... you have to believe me!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_D;The look on [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s face is pure disappointment. "We had high hopes for you, [Root.GetFirstName], although it seems we were mistaken." I swallow. Loudly. "This cowardice makes you useless to us. Your gold, on the other hand..." As I leave, my intended victim in tow, my hands will not stop shaking.;x
EVTOPTD_6038;You... you have my gratitude.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6039;You have no idea what happened as you wake up on the floor of your [Root.GetChamber], a taste of blood in your mouth and a pounding ache along the side of your face. Slowly, the memories come back. A hooded [Root.GetManWoman]... The Assassins. Perhaps you should consider yourself lucky, getting away with only a black eye.;x
EVTOPTA_6039;A life of secrecy might not be for me, after all.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_6104_A;There is a solemn, almost reverential, atmosphere as the crowd pours out of the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] after the [Root.GetReligiousRite]. I follow the flow of people absentmindedly while I ponder what the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] said regarding right and wrong, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Suddenly, I stumble. A moment later something heavy pushes me down into the dirt.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_B;As the cell door creaks I steady myself. [Host.GetTitledFirstName]'s jailer is a brute of a [Host.GetManWoman]. However, when faint light of a distant torch reveals the silhouette in the doorway, my heart sinks from its position in my stomach to the floor. This is not the jailer. And... is that a dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_C;I open my eyes and suddenly I feel wide awake. Something is not right, I can sense it with all my being. Why is the window open...?\nThe whisper emerging from the shadows is soft as silk. "Did you think you could escape the Assassins, [Root.GetFirstName]?";x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_D;The atmosphere at court grows more strained each day, so I thought a little feast would do us all good.

EVTDESC_MNM_6104_E;It... it is so hard to breathe. A heavy weight is pressing down on me, constricting my chest, pushing the air out of my lungs. As the worlds come in to focus I see a figure hovering over me. Is that a dagger?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_F;I am conversing with [conversationalist.GetTitledFirstName] over the main course when the loud clatter of a serving dish crashing to the floor makes me jump out of my seat. I face the clumsy servant but words fail me as I discover the dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_6105_A;"I am here to carry out Allah's judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]." The [assassin.GetManWoman]'s voice is deep, tinted with a strange accent.

EVTDESC_MNM_6105_B;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins." There is nowhere to run. Nothing within reach to use as a weapon. [assassin.GetSheHeCap] points the dagger at me, and says solemnly: "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_C;I grasp for the dagger under my pillow, but the shock of this unexpected visit has made my fingers stiff and movement imprecise. Before I can find it, the hooded figure is upon me. A dagger glints in the faint moonlight. "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";x
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_D;"The time has come for the judgment of Allah!" The guests fall silent as the [assassin.GetManWoman]'s shout echoes through the hall.

EVTOPTA_MNM_6105;This is the end, then?;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7830_gluttonous;My agents have uncovered rumors that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] rather enjoys his feasts.

EVTDESC_MNM_7830_deceitful;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s court appears to be in a mild state of confusion.

EVTDESC_MNM_7832_lustful;The raunchy nights of pleasure and debauchery I hosted at my court for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] seem to have truly freed [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] remaining inhibitions. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] is most thankful to me for showing [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] needs not be ashamed of pursuing pleasure.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_gluttonous;The lavish feast to which I invited [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] have paid off, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already started to consume vast quantities of the delicacies I introduced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to. Before [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] made sure I understood how grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was for the experience.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_greedy;During our games of chance [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] struggled more and more to hide [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] fondness for the gold coins on the table. With some well-placed words I managed to make [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] come to terms with [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greed. Letting [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] win most of the games ensured [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left both thankful and in high spirits.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_slothful;Over the past few days [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I did almost every conceivable thing... except managing a court. I have never seen [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] happier, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seemed most excited to spend less time ruling and more time enjoying life.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_envious;As we feasted I subtly directed the conversation towards [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s neighbor. Through carefully-dropped hints I convinced [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does indeed rightfully covet much that is owned by others. The reinforcing effect this had on [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] envy has already become very clear.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_wroth;I slipped some coins to a servant in return for him bumping into [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] in a hallway during [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] visit. Only a few words from me were needed to unleash [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s anger upon the servant. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] afterwards confessed to me how liberating it was to let out [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] anger, and was most grateful I helped [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to discover this.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_proud;Over the course of the celebrations [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s ego inflated like a bloated cow. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] has already become insufferable to be around, but at least [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was exceedingly grateful that I 'finally recognized [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greatness'...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_deceitful;As we feasted, I eventually subtly turned the conversation to the small lies [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] uses for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] amusement. We discussed how [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe], by using [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] talent for lies, could reap far greater rewards than mere 'amusement'. Thoughtfully, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] agreed, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_arbitrary;With my calm support [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] began to visibly enjoy sentencing people based on, for instance, their appearance, or the first sentence of their defense. A grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] afterwards told me [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] far preferred this over the tedious process of listening to lengthy explanations...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_cruel;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a lot of fun in the dungeons. The prisoners, not so much. Both [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] and I discovered a new side of [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that was quite... unsettling. Not that it detracted from his gratitude.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_bonus;It seems that liberating [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] virtue has had unforeseen effects... Having finally discovered what [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has missed out on for all these years, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] has sunk headlong into utter depravity.;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_7832_TOOLTIP;[corrupt_priest_spell_caster.GetDWDevil] will surely bless me greatly!\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7834;Despite my best efforts, one misplaced word was all that was needed for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] to take offense from my suggestion. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] stormed out of the room indignantly, and what's far worse, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] outed my supposed 'wickedness' to everyone!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_7834;Oh no...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_7834_TOOLTIP;People will not be happy to hear this...\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_chaste;A lingering touch here, slightly too long a glance there... [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] might not be entirely as chaste as [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] pretends to be. I have just the servant for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to meet. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_temperate;Some of [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s servants reportedly saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] sneak into the kitchen at night to enjoy some leftovers. If I could speak to [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] in private I am sure I could convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there is no need for secrecy on these matters. Perhaps [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] would like to visit my court? I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_charitable;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] at times seems almost reluctant to give to others. With a good example [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could be acquainted with the joys of keeping wealth to yourself. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_diligent;It's almost as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] works hard because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has been taught to, and not because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] believes [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] should. I should show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that it is alright not to be a slave to hard work. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_kind;Occasionally [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s smiles and gentle words seem rather forced. With some help I am sure [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could come to understand that one does not always need to be all smiles with everyone. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_patient;Regular sighs and long, annoyed pauses give away that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as patient as is widely thought. Keeping all that frustration pent up inside cannot be healthy. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_humble;At times, when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does not receive his due credit, my agents report it almost seems as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is about to speak up. I will show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how it feels to be recognized! I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_honest;Honesty has more than once gotten [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] into trouble. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] should learn how to avoid it by using little white lies. I shall write the invitation...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_just;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] has allegedly voiced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] annoyance that being just is so time-consuming. Surely I can make [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] see how cutting a few corners could save [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] a lot of time. I shall write the invitation...;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7837_chaste;I saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s glances at the servant during our conversation. With a few encouraging words I got them to seclude themselves, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] returned a changed [corrupt_priest_target.GetManWoman]. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most pleased with my support!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_temperate;Having ensured that I caught [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] eating leftovers in the kitchen after our banquet, I managed to soothe [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] worries and convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there was no reason to continue to pretend to have a small appetite. Our next banquet was far more enjoyable...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_charitable;Using a display of wealth, I managed to convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] that sometimes money is of better use in one's own pockets. Thoroughly enticed by the prospect, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most pleased someone had spoken so frankly to him on these matters.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_diligent;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] by example that one can achieve things without working hard. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] truly seemed to enjoy the time spent at my court, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already resolved to spend less time working hard when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] returns home.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_kind;The servant I had bribed continued his insolence for hours, before [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s kindness finally broke. We had a good long discussion afterwards, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally understood that some people are simply not deserving of kindness. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_patient;As I heard [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] sigh in frustration at the servant's incompetence, I gave the lad a piece of my mind. Before long, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s patience ended and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] joined me in a display of our anger. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] was incredibly grateful for the release, and seems to have done away with patience since.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_humble;All that was needed was to insist on giving [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] the credit that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was due. After some half-hearted attempts at avoiding it, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally accepted the praise, and seems to have gotten a taste for recognition now.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_honest;A simple demonstration of talking my way out of an embarrassing situation by using a small lie was enough to get [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] interested. With some explanation and reassurance that nobody would get hurt, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seems to have finally abandoned [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] honesty.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_just;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] how quickly I judged some of the more bothersome criminals based on my intuition rather than a detailed examination of the facts. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most impressed, and has already started following my example!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_7837;I am so altruistic!;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7841;In the middle of the night, I seclude myself in the room I have meticulously prepared for tonight's [Root.GetDWDarkMagic].

EVTDESC_MNM_7843;The ritual was a resounding success! [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have taken quite a liking to me, and is now far more amenable to my suggestions. The unfortunate side effect is that [possess_courtier_target.GetSheHe] has become quite obviously... insane.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_7844;Not everything has gone according to plan. Although something quite clearly seems to have taken up residence within [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName], whatever it is does not seem to be inclined to make [possess_courtier_target.GetFirstName] more loyal towards you...;x

EVTDESC_MNM_4605;With patient dedication [benedictines_diligent_mentor.GetTitledFirstName] has shown me how to create a horarium to assign my time appropriately, making it easier to structure the work I do. It has already proven to be most useful, and work comes more easily to me now.;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_8022;I knew I shouldn't have trusted those locals!;x

EVTDESC_MNM_8023;A large group of mounted warriors block our way.

#Arrival to pilgrimage sites;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8050;Arrival in Sarnath;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8050;A short journey from the holy city of Varanasi lies Sarnath. This is the park in which Buddha gave his first sermons, setting the wheel of the Dharma in motion, telling his followers of the four noble truths and founding the Sangha itself. Today the park is home to the imposing Dhamek Stupa and over a thousand priests and monks.\n\nThis is one of the most bustling centers of Buddhist teachings in India and one of the sites named by the Buddha himself as a worthy pilgrimage.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8050;I must seek the middle way.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8051;Bodh Gaya;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8051;You have finally arrived in Bodh Gaya, by many considered the seat of Buddhism. It was here that Buddha once sat under the tree of enlightenment, meditating on the mysteries of the universe. Over the centuries rulers and influentials both in India and further away have contributed to a great number of temples, monasteries and shrines at this post. To this day the monks of Bodh Gaya has kept a giant Bodhi Tree alive here, a huge pipal right next to the 'Diamond Throne' that a ruler of another age built to commemorate the event.\n\nAs you approach the blue tiled walls of the massive Mahabodhi temple you reflect on how different this site must be from when Buddha himself came here. At that point he was not unlike yourself, a simple ascetic seeking enlightenment.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8051;I too seek to be enlightened.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8052;Sanchi;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8052;You have finally arrived in Sanchi, one of the oldest centers of Buddhist worship in the world. Legend has it the original Stupa here was constructed by Emperor Ashoka at the insistence of his Vidishan queen Devi. Ever since Buddhists have been coming here to seek out the serenely secluded environment, and over hundreds of years more temples, stupas and monasteries have sprung up in this ideal place for monastic life.\n\nAs you approach the elaborate Torana of the ancient Great Stupa of Ashoka you reflect on the generations of faithful that have walked this way before you as well as on the fate of Sariputra and Mahamoggalana whose relics lie within.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8052;As is fitting for a disciple of Buddha.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8053;Shravanabelagola;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8053;You have finally arrived in Shravanabelagola, the white pond of the Shravana. For centuries great monks and Sravakas have meditated here on the hills of Chandragiri and Vindhyagiri, among them even great kings and emperors. As you approach the main pond you reflect on the faith of Bahubali whose atonement for his sins and sublimation into godhood is commemorated here by a 57 feet statue in his likeness. Shravanabelagola is the site of many Jain mathas and temples and is the site where some of the holiest scriptures are kept.\n\nFortunately you have arrived in time for the Mahamastakabhisheka ceremony and get to watch as the statue of Bahubali is bathed and anointed and sprinkled with powders of Sandalwood and Vermilion.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8053;It is time I proceed to the temples and mathas of this place.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8054;Girnar;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8054;You have arrived in the temple district of Taleti at the foot of Girnar. A long set of stairs will take you up the sacred mountain to see the shrines and temples. It was here that Krishna was once confined by his mother and where he tricked Kalayavana to meet the inflaming ire of the sleeping Muchukunda.\n\nAs you reach the Bhavnat shrine you observe the hundreds of naked Sadhus making their offerings to Shiva and bathing themselves in the tank of the temple. The entire place is resounding with sounds and music and according to some Shiva himself is near.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8054;I must continue my ascent.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8055;Arrival at Shikarji;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8055;Having crossed the Madhuban forest, you have finally reached the foot of the Parasnath hills and the pilgrimage of Shikarji. On these mountain peaks 20 out of the 24 tirthankaras achieved moksha through meditation making this one of the holiest of places in the world. Their ascent to Nirvana has left a permanent mark on this place, and during your climb upwards to the sacred peaks you pass the small marble tonks left to commemorate each and every one of them.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8055;It is time to begin my ascent.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8056;Arrival in Mathura.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8056;You have finally arrived at the heart of Braj, in Mathura, the place where lord Krishna was once born. It is said the first temple constructed at this ancient site was built by Vajranabha, the great-grandson of Krishna himself. Since then the devoted have travelled to this place to give their offerings and see this most holy of Hindu places. Today thousands of pilgrims come here, and to the nearby Vrindavan where Krishna spent his youth, every year to circumambulate Govardhana and the other temples.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8056;It is beautiful!;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8057;The Eternal City;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8057;At the confluence of the Varuna and the Assi lies one of the oldest cities of India. Known by names such as Varanasi, Kasi or Banaras this is also one of the holiest places in the world. For thousands of years pilgrims have visited the hundreds of temples and the many ghats that lead into the holy river Ganges. They have sought enlightenment and purification or in some cases, to die in this place where salvation is guaranteed.\n\nEager to perform your own cleansing you approach the Dashashwamedh Ghats, a set of stairs said to have been created to welcome Shiva by lord Brahma millennia ago, you reflect on Ganges, Krishna and the cycle of rebirth.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8057;I believe it is time for a bath!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8061;This place is invigorating to the mind. Being able to engage with so many great minds of religion and theology has stimulated my understanding and willingness to explore the finer points of the faith. Hours and even days are lost in conversation with Sadhus, Priests and Monks about the deeper meaning of various passages in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].;x
#EVTOPTA_MNM_8061;The study of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] will be my foremost priority from now on.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8061;Enlightenment can only be achieved through Meditation.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8062;Purification and Enlightenment have never before felt as tangible as in this place. Pilgrims are circumambulating shrines, sadhus are conveying their blessings upon the faithful and monks and gurus meditate together. I join those in worship that for thousands of years have attended this place and others like it. This is a profound experience unlike anything I have ever felt before.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8062;I cannot wait to tell others about this!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8063;Many pilgrims have stories of the experiences from their journeys and the great enlightenment or purification achieved in at the destination. I expected much more than I have found here. The place is certainly full of monks, sadhus, priests and holy men but neither circumambulation, meditation or cleansing has left me with anything but an empty feeling of doubt.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8063;What is my purpose here?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8064;Eager to engage other in discussion I rushed right ahead to the centers of learning. I can tell the ideas and thoughts I have had over the years have made an impression on others here. Even great minds, scholars and sadhus alike seem taken by my reasoning and my home-grown theological arguments.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8064;It is but a small contribution to the knowledge of mankind.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8065;There are people here from every corner of the world. Though we are united in reverence of this holy place their languages, clothes and even the people themselves seem exotic and different. Meeting and conversing with strangers is in itself an experience that will impact me more than the religious aspects of this pilgrimage itself.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8065;I must talk to them all!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8065;I must observe and learn about the peoples of this world.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8066;A pilgrimage can be undertaken for many reasons. For some it is a way to atone for past sins, for others a way to repay the universe for what they have. To many the pilgrimage is a great and rejuvenating journey. I feel convinced this is so, for my journey has left me invigorated in a way I have never experienced before.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8066;Perhaps the time has come to begin the journey home?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8067;Like me many others have come here to seek the spiritual experience of their life. To some this is draining but I find it to be quite invigorating. With the appetite of the mind sated perhaps it is time to enjoy myself?;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8067;Yes, why not?;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8067;I must exercise control of the body as well as the mind.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_8068;Healer?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8068;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. After completing my cleansing bath in the Ganges and started to climb back up the ghats I met an old wrinkled man who bestowed his blessing upon me. Ever since I have felt more powerful and invigorated.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8068_b;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. Knowing that their blessings are said to have great power I could not help but seek out one who is said to have a way to heal the sick. I spent some time with this man and ate and drank a variety of things according to his instructions. For the most part it is hard to remember what happened but it appears I slept for several days before leaving him with a feeling of invigoration I have not felt for a long time.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8068;I have been healed by a higher power!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8068;This man was truly a great healer.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_8068;I must learn more about this mystery!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8070;Surrounded by pilgrims, temples and shrines it is hard not to be taken aback by the great faith of the masses. Their reverence really is quite endearing. Should I reveal my true identity to them and receive their open adoration and worship? What better place to do this than here, a destination they have all sought out to experience my favor...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8070;Let them see me for who I truly am!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8070;They could not bear to receive me in full glory, for now I must spare them.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8071;Enrichment of the spirit is all well and good but perhaps it is now time to see what the temporal world has to offer. Surely there is both food, good company and good drink to be had nearby? Now that I am here I must sate my appetite for the local delicacies.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8071;Let us see what this place truly has to offer...;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_8071;I must strive to overcome the crass demands of flesh and bone.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8072;The adoration I thought I saw was clearly nothing but blind stupidity! These pilgrims are fools and do not know the full extent of my power. The lucky ones may never find out but those that ejected me from the temple grounds will curse this day.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8072;They do not realize what they have awoken...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8091;I am home at last after my journey. I have learnt new things, experienced the greatness of the faith and met with interesting people. While it is good to be home I am confident that I will always remember this trip very fondly.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8091;A great experience!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8092;I am home at last after a long journey. While it is said that a pilgrimage can rejuvenate the soul and body I cannot claim it did for me. On the whole this has been a most disappointing experience.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8092;My home is my castle.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_8093;I am finally home after a long and tiring journey. Though the insolent rats did not recognize me or pay proper homage, it was still an enlightening experience. Now there is plenty of time to prepare their day of reckoning.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_8093;They will pay for their shortsightedness.;x

As morning approached I returned to my lonely bed, where I spent some time with a fantasy before drifting off to sleep...;x
EVTOPTA_4407_LUSTFUL;Well, that was a futile effort.;x
EVTDESC_4408_LUSTFUL;At first, every day I went without a [Root.GetManWomanPreference]'s touch felt like torture.

Afterwards, I returned to my chambers, thinking that was the end of it. However, it turns out that someone saw me, and now everyone knows!;x
EVTOPTA_4409_LUSTFUL;I must learn to control this!;x
EVTDESC_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I know that [Root.GetMOSaint] was a paragon of temperance, however I struggle to control my appetite. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I am supposed to eat very simple food in small portions, but I am growing weary. I cannot concentrate when my stomach rumbles like this!;x
EVTOPTA_4405_GLUTTONOUS;After a little treat I shall return to my duties with doubled focus!;x
EVTOPTB_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I shall defeat my desires with a fast!;x
EVTDESC_4406_GLUTTONOUS;I waited until midnight before I made my way to the kitchens. I found some of my favorite treats in one of the pantries. After many days on the most dreary of diets, they tasted like the most delicious food I had ever eaten! My appetite is satiated for now and no one is the wiser.;x
EVTOPTA_4406_GLUTTONOUS;That was exactly what I needed.;x
EVTDESC_4407_GLUTTONOUS;After midnight I ventured to the kitchens to find something to still my hunger. I quickly found my favorite treats and proceeded to shove handfuls into my mouth. However, my binge was interrupted as a servant entered the room. As I hid in the pantry, the shame washed over me, and I could not eat anything else.;x
EVTOPTA_4407_GLUTTONOUS;Now I just feel nauseated...;x
EVTDESC_4408_GLUTTONOUS;During the first days of my fast, I felt as if I was going to die. As I woke on the third day, however, I was surprised by how clear my mind was and how little the lack of sustenance bothered me. The next day when I broke my fast and returned to my simple diet, it was more than enough to satisfy me.;x
EVTOPTA_4408_GLUTTONOUS;I am stronger than I thought.;x
EVTDESC_4409_GLUTTONOUS;The first day of the fast went reasonably well, but on the second one, I woke up ravenous. I thought I would die! I hurried to the kitchen, ignoring the servants' stares. Once there I proceeded to shove anything edible I could find into my mouth, not caring who saw me. Now everyone knows about my failure!;x
EVTOPTA_4409_GLUTTONOUS;How could I shame myself so?;x

However, I often feel reluctant when doing so, and it brings me shame. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I have had plenty of time to think about this. Perhaps I should strive to be more charitable?;x
EVTOPTA_4405_GREEDY;I still give, don't I? Surely that must be enough.;x
EVTOPTB_4405_GREEDY;I don't give enough. I will make another donation!;x
EVTDESC_4406_GREEDY;After coming to the realization that I am already doing so much for my subjects as their [Root.GetTitle], I have been able to put the thought about charity out of my mind. It does not distract me any longer.;x
EVTOPTA_4406_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], on the whole.;x
EVTDESC_4407_GREEDY;I thought I was happy with my decision, but then the guilt came creeping. I should not crave money and possessions in this way. These feelings are not in accordance with [Root.GetMOCode], but I cannot help myself.;x
EVTOPTA_4407_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], am I not? Surely?;x
EVTDESC_4408_GREEDY;I ordered one of my most trusted servants to take a substantial sum of money from my personal treasury and bring it to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. Strangely enough, when [Root.GetSheHe] left, I felt... relief. Perhaps this is the first step towards freeing myself of the desire for material possessions?;x
EVTOPTA_4408_GREEDY;The money will come to good use, I am sure.;x
#EVTDESC_4409_GREEDY;I ordered one of my most trusted servants to take a substantial sum of money from my personal treasury and bring it to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. However, as soon as [Root.GetSheHe] left the room, a feeling of overwhelming unease came over me, and I could not focus on my prayers. The feeling kept growing by the minute and when my servant returned I immediately demanded that [Root.GetSheHe] would go and get the money back. Now everyone knows about my greed!;x
EVTOPTA_4409_GREEDY;I wish I wouldn't have acted so rashly...;x
EVTDESC_4405_SLOTHFUL;For a true follower of [Root.GetMOCode], the importance of saying [Root.GetPrayers] and studying [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] – at least my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] says so. However, while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] for days on end, I struggle to stay focused. Sometimes I feel that I am just sitting here, doing nothing. If I closed my eyes for just a moment... surely that would not be so bad?;x
EVTOPTA_4405_SLOTHFUL;A little nap would do me good.;x
EVTOPTB_4405_SLOTHFUL;If I am getting tired, I must double my efforts!;x
EVTDESC_4406_SLOTHFUL;I was so immensely bored by my [Root.GetPrayers] and [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], but after a little nap my duties did not feel quite so impossible anymore. I cannot expect myself to become like [Root.GetMOSaint] overnight. One step at a time, I say!;x
EVTOPTA_4406_SLOTHFUL;That was wise of me.;x
EVTDESC_4407_SLOTHFUL;Waking up was an unpleasant experience, to say the least. I had sunk to the floor and also managed to get drool all over the chest of my garb. When I sluggishly pushed myself back to seated, I was aghast to realize that the room was pitch black! It was in the middle of the night and every single candle had burned out.;x
EVTOPTA_4407_SLOTHFUL;It was only supposed to be a little nap!;x
EVTDESC_4408_SLOTHFUL;During the first hours every minute felt like an eternity, but then it got easier. My weariness was as good as gone and a certain passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] grabbed my interest. I kept reading, consumed by the powerful words, and suddenly it was morning! I went to sleep with a smile upon my lips and a renewed sense of purpose.;x
EVTOPTA_4408_SLOTHFUL;Self-control is far greater a reward than indulgence.;x
EVTDESC_4409_SLOTHFUL;I do not remember falling asleep, but suddenly I realized I was sprawled across the floor. Apparently I had crashed on top of my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], because once I struggled to my feet I noticed that its pages were torn and that I had ink smeared across my face. No matter how hard I tried, I could not wash it off. Surely my servants are gossiping about my failure, and soon everyone will know!;x
EVTOPTA_4409_SLOTHFUL;What an embarrassment!;x

EVTDESC_MNM_4410;For me, the biggest challenge while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] is the solitude. As I sit here and reflect upon [Root.GetMOCode], thoughts enter my mind which I desperately want to share with someone, but I have barely exchanged a single word since I began my seclusion. I glance out of my window only to see [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] engaged in a lively conversation with some friends.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4410;I will go down there and join them, if only for a few minutes!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4410;I should stay here, alone with my thoughts.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4411;While [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] and [potential_friend.GetHerHis] friends were surprised to see me, they were excellent company! As I stood there, surrounded by people, I could not stop talking. What was supposed to be a few minutes turned into an hour before my companions had to excuse themselves and get back to their duties.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4411;That was nice, although I know I shouldn't have.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4412;This is the challenge I have been given, and I will not give up so quickly. I returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. During the first few pages, thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me, but after a while I found peace in my reading.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4412;Being alone is not so bad, after all.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4413;I left the window and returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. However, my heart was not really in it, and thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me. Then my thoughts drifted to my own companions, and how they had made no attempts to get in touch for weeks...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4413;How did [Root.GetMOSaint] cope with this loneliness?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4414;I cannot make sense of this passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]! The words are archaic and their meaning is deeply hidden by copious layers of symbolism. It would greatly benefit my spiritual development if I discovered the text's essence on my own, although at this point, perhaps I would be better of asking my [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4414;I will figure this out on my own.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4414;There is no shame in asking for help.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_4415;A true follower of [Root.GetMOCode] does not give up easily. I kept at it, reading the passage again and again, compared it with other holy texts and mulled over the wording for hours at end. It went slowly, but every now and then I uncovered a new piece of the puzzle, and suddenly, I saw it! Such elegance, such depth! I will carry this revelation with me until the day I die.;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_4415_B;The wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] is infinite and indisputable.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4416;In my obstinacy, I refused to ask for help. Surely I, the [Root.GetTitle], would know enough of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to understand the meaning of this passage! Hour upon hour I sat staring at the words, trying to make sense of them, but each interpretation I could think of felt lackluster and hollow...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4416_A;The wisdom of [Root.GetMOGod] is beyond my understanding.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4416_B;The wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] is beyond my understanding.;x

With [court_spiritual.GetFirstName]'s patient guidance, I managed to make sense of it at the end!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4418;I immediately sought out [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle] [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] to request [court_spiritual.GetHerHis] aid. I seemed to have caught [court_spiritual.GetHerHim] at a bad time, however, for [court_spiritual.GetSheHe] agreed with some discernible reluctance.

I then failed to engage my [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon] in a conversation about the passage, so I considered myself defeated and sent [interrupting_child.GetHerHim] on [interrupting_child.GetHerHis] way.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4423;My [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon] has... other qualities.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4424;I patiently explained to [interrupting_child.GetFirstName] that I was preoccupied with holy duties, and that I would return to court once they were finished.

the_assassins_desc;The elusive Assassins consider themselves the true followers of Allah, and will do anything to further the advances of Shia Islam and protect their fellow believers. Consisting of loyal warriors as well as competent spies, wielding manipulation and social skills as expertly as a dagger, they specialize in asymmetrical warfare, striking hard at the heart of their enemies.;x
#the_satanists_desc;Highly secretive, the covens of the Satanists refuse the doctrine of traditional theologians, finding abstinence from earthly pleasures foolish and dishonest. Praising the Devil, who encourages them to follow their impulses, allows them to instead indulge and follow a path that would outrage any god-fearing man or woman.;x
#the_trollcrafters_desc;The Trollcrafters are a secret fellowship frowned upon by devout pagans, proclaiming Freyja grants them sorcery of old. Some say they are selfish manipulators and schemers, while others are frightened by the rumors surrounding them, such as those of elaborate human sacrifices and unnatural longevity...;x
the_cult_of_kali_desc;The Cult of Kali Purusha worship the demonic aspect of Kali, and refuse the shackles of conventional belief as they see no fault in acts committed out of selfishness. Their spirituality is instead centered around personal gain and lustful endeavors, condemning them in the eyes of traditional believers.;x
the_plaguebringers_desc;The Plaguebringers worship what traditional believers would call evil spirits, as they curse their enemies with disease and turn to the Erlik, the God of Death, to achieve their personal goals. Most unsettling are the rumors that they carry very little qualms in regards to how this dark favor is gained...;x
the_cold_ones_desc;The Cold Ones believe that certain people are born with witch's blood and it is their blessing to be able to turn to Chernobog, the Black God, to gain power and wealth. They are frowned upon by traditional believers, who would rather call them cursed, as they are rumored to sacrifice humans and commit heinous acts in order to achieve their goals.;x
monastic_order_benedictine_desc;The Benedictine Order is an old monastic community with 'Ora et Labora', meaning 'pray and labor', as their motto. Often recognized by their black habits, they worship God and find purpose in prayer and quiet contemplation as well as scholarly work.;x
monastic_order_dominican_desc;The Dominican Order are able to listen to the confessions of any Christian – dressed in white and black, they lead the holy inquisition, charged with a mission to identify heretics. As a lay member of their Order you are expected to not pursue material wealth, but strive to be a seeker of truth.;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_3399;I'll make them see.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3202;My advisors inform me that [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] has been overheard questioning my loyalty to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When I summon [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHim], [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] is apologetic, but a raised eyebrow tells of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] doubt. "It's just a rumor, my [Root.GetLordLady]... You are not overly interested in [Root.GetReligiousRite], but you could surely quote any passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] without hesitation...?";x

EVTOPTC_MNM_3202;Is there any way I can make you think otherwise, [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName]...?;x
#EVTOPTC_MNM_3202_TOOLTIP;You slip a pouch of money into [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] hand, slightly slowing the progress of your mission.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3204;As I began reciting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s eyes widened. I intentionally focused on what I believed to be [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] favorite passage, speaking clearly to [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] interests as a [stubborn_courtier.GetEducationRole]. My gambit seems to have paid off because the deep bow [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] bestowed upon me was nothing short of embarrassment and an eagerness to make up for [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] obvious blunder.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3205;As I rack my brain for the appropriate lines to shove triumphantly in [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s face, my palms grow sweaty.\n"Ezekiel 25:17! I will carry out great vengeance on them..." I begin. Then a slow panic begins to rise within my chest. [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] frowns. \n"No, wait, that doesn't seem right. That's not..." I mumble as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] shakes [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] head and with a roll of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] eyes walks away, leaving me alone with my failure. By the damnation of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], how did I get this so wrong?;x

#EVTOPTA_MNM_3205_TOOLTIP_FAILURE;§Y[stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName]§! is unimpressed, causing you to lose some progress in your mission.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3206;I make it clear to [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] that it seems almost heretical for someone supposedly well-versed in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to display such a poor understanding of the relationship between a ruler and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n[stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] clearly did not expect to have their own religious understanding challenged, and I try not to smile to myself as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] sputters an apology.

As I followed up with stories of other unfortunate souls who had questioned their liege's faith, [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] grin remained. When [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] finally departed, it was with an even more disconcerting sentence. "I know exactly where my soul belongs, but I am unsure about yours.";x

#EVTOPTC_MNM_3209_TOOLTIP;You distract §Y[concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName]§! by changing the subject completely, slightly slowing the progress of your mission.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3211;I regale [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] with tales of my "dark dreams" of strange and foreign rituals. [concerned_friend.GetSheHeCap] can barely believe the vividness with which I describe the faith of the unbelievers.

EVTDESC_MNM_3213;I tried to reassure [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] that everything is as it should, and soon enough we were conversing and laughing like we used to.

EVTDESC_3221_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and I must admit to feeling better after talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. While I left out the most important details of my current spiritual anxieties, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] concluded our meeting by placing an encouraging hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it, my [Root.GetLordLady].";x
EVTDESC_3221_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural], somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology.

EVTDESC_3222_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and at first I felt a lot better simply talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. I struggled to leave out the details of my current spiritual anxieties, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] shot me glances of concern throughout our meeting. As we parted, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it... Even if you are not, my [Root.GetLordLady].";x

EVTDESC_3222_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I am at a loss for words.

"I know you are struggling with your faith, my friend" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] then says, before continuing: "– but you must stop. For the sake of the realm.";x
EVTOPTA_3222_TRUSTING;Oh no! I cannot afford rumors of my faith wavering!;x

EVTDESC_3223_TRUSTING;I invited [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] to a walk today. While not disclosing too much, I gently steered our conversation towards [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] theological views. "I think perhaps that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is just a name, for a concept we share with many, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] admitted in the end.;x
EVTDESC_3223_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology.

EVTDESC_3224_TRUSTING;I have been avoiding [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] for some time now. When [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] eventually caught me, it was awkward. "Something has changed in you, my [Root.GetLordLady]" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] said stiffly. My stomach lurched. "It is not you, it is I", I confessed. Then I told [trusted_friend.GetHerHim] that I've been doubting [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s plan for me. [trusted_friend.GetSheHeCap] seemed unimpressed. I hope I have not said too much.;x
EVTDESC_3224_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology... When I was finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I shrunk into my chair. "Surely, we have more important things to discuss", I mumbled. "More important than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], my [Root.GetLordLady]?" came the retort, aghast.;x
EVTDESC_3224_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I am at a loss for words.

"I refused to believe the rumors, but you truly do not believe in our [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] anymore, do you? My [Root.GetTitle], you'll doom us all.";x
EVTOPTA_3224_TRUSTING;I thought [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] would understand.;x

The worshipers gasp as I, their [Root.GetTitle], begin quoting fragments of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. I roll my eyes back as I speak, as if confronting the skies themselves. When my last words ring out, they start to whisper. For a moment I am convinced that my stunt has succeeded. Then the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] prods at me. "Uhm, my [Root.GetLordLady]?

EVTDESC_MNM_3230_B;I have arranged for my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName] to help me with readings of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. [Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] commented that such a studiousness is evidence of a true faithful!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_C;In my efforts to blend in with the believers around me, I believe I have come to learn more [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] theology than most of them know themselves.\nThey would be foolish to challenge my understanding of the faith.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_D;A group of courtiers spotted me praying today. As they came within earshot I made sure to mutter the name of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] repeatedly.\nThey ended up joining me in my prayer.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_E;I passed by a beggar in the street today and quoted a passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to her, loud enough for anyone passing by to hear. Apparently the exchange became quite the conversation starter at court!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_3230_F;I was studying copied pages of [Root.GetTrueReligionScriptureName] with a fellow faithful when a servant entered my room unannounced.

secret_religious_society_jewish_desc;Hidden Jewish communities have organized under oppression ever since the time of the Babylonian captivity.

This is how the followers of Tengri can be so certain in their faith that they follow it even in the face of persecution. All they have to do to prove their faith is to lift their eyes towards Tengri of the Blue Sky above, feel the protection nature provides, and let their Wind Horses ride in prayer to a better place.;x

secret_religious_society_hindu_desc;Followers of Hinduism believe it to be The Eternal Way, and even when forced to utter the blessings of another spirit, some know that in the samsara all things will come to pass, and the natural order of things will return. In the cycle of destruction and creation, death and rebirth, endings and beginnings, no other truth will stand victorious for long.;x
secret_religious_society_buddhist;the Eightfold Path;x
secret_religious_society_buddhist_desc;Those who secretly follow the teachings of Buddha focus on asceticism and distancing themselves of worldly possessions as much as they can without notice. A belief in rebirth into the wheel of life and death makes them distance themselves of all cravings, which bring only pain. There are those who would rather plant a good karmic seed through rebirth than renounce these teachings, as an open profession of faith is not always needed to grow closer to Nirvana.;x
secret_religious_society_jain;the Harmless;x
secret_religious_society_jain_desc;To conquer all inner passions is to become Jina. The Jains take five vows of self- discipline and asceticism in their search of spiritual development. Ahmisa: to love and cause no harm to other living beings. Satya: to always speak the truth. Asteya: to never take that which is not willingly offered. Brahmacharya: to adopt chastity or celibacy. Aparigraha: the renunciation of worldly possessions. To be Jain is to never break such vows, even when doing so is in itself a secret that tries Satya to its very limits.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_3264;I was beginning to think that [From.GetTitledFirstName] took offense to my comments, but today I have received a new draft of [From.GetHerHis] work – I am surprised to find that [From.GetHerHis] words really speak to me.

EVTOPTD_MNM_4202;This seems like a waste of my time.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4204;Escorted through the gardens of the monastery, I immediately spot the work of [From.GetSisterBrother] [From.GetFirstName]. The roses are a delicate mixture of red and yellow, a hue of sunset at their center. "They're beautiful", my escort nods, offering me a small spade. "They're a little cramped over there though, would you mind helping out?";x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4204;I would love to! There is something... grounding, to gardening.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_4206;It seems that [From.GetSisterBrother] [From.GetFirstName] has received the sample from my garden that I sent [From.GetHerHim].

EVTDESC_MNM_4212;While attending prayer one early morning, I notice my [From.GetSisterBrother] [From.GetFirstName] drowsing off in [From.GetHerHis] seat. Meanwhile, our fellow members of [This.Society.GetName] are deep in their contemplation and do not seem to have noticed yet.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4212;I should wake [From.GetHerHim], before anyone catches on.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4212;[From.GetSheHeCap] looks like [From.GetSheHe] could use a nap...;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_4212;I think I heard [From.GetHerHim] request a mustache.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4214;I gently prod at [From.GetFirstName], but I get no reaction. Then I shove my elbow into [From.GetHerHis] side, causing [From.GetHerHim] to cough and open [From.GetHerHis] eyes, a flash of anger in them. [From.GetHerHisCap] face turns red as [From.GetSheHe] blinks, the situation dawning on [From.GetHerHim] suddenly. "Thank you", [From.GetSheHe] mumbles, sheepishly.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4214;Think nothing of it, friend.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_4214;It seems I saved you from some real embarrassment there...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4215;As [From.GetFirstName] continues [From.GetHerHis] nap, it does not take long before [From.GetSheHe] starts to snore. I discretely edge away from [From.GetHerHim], and when [From.GetSheHe] finally wakes up, it is to the faces of disapproval from [From.GetHerHis] companions. How awkward for [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_4215;[From.GetSheHeCap] did look rather comfortable there, for a while...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_4216;I scurry off to fetch some ink, before I gently sit down beside the lightly sleeping [From.GetFirstName] and begin my work. It takes a few minutes, but in the end I am more than satisfied – [From.GetHerHis] new mustache is marvelous! For some reason, [From.GetSisterBrother] [From.GetFirstName] does not return my smile when [From.GetSheHe] awakes from [From.GetHerHis] slumber.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_9122;I was struck with nervous excitement when [From.GetMasterMistressCap] [From.GetFirstName] announced that the [From.GetWeaponsmithWeapon] was nearing its completion.

EVTDESC_MNM_9124;[From.GetMasterMistressCap] [From.GetFirstName]'s main assistant has brought me the finished [From.GetWeaponsmithWeapon]. There are no engravings or precious materials to enhance it, but the design has some elegance of its own. Looking pretty is not her main purpose, anyway.;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_44511;It is a great honor, [From.GetSocietyRank].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6901;I am trying to focus on my training, but [From.GetSheHe] is always there! No matter if I am studying in the great Order library, hid behind piles of books, or sparring with a fellow Assassin, [From.GetTitledFirstName] apparently has to do the same. And [From.GetHerHis] taunts and snide comments! They are driving me mad!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6901;It is time to really determine who the superior assassin is.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6901_TT;Challenge §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!. This might have a number of outcomes, depending on whether you win or lose and how [From.GetSheHe] takes it. You might learn a permanent or temporary skill, get injured, gain a new friend or declare a new rival.;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_6901_TT;Ignore §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and focus on your training.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6908_A;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not slow to accept my challenge. It was a simple one: we would both craft disguises and enter the nearby town at noon the next day. The first person to spot the other, sneak up on them and place a dagger at their throat would be the winner!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6908_B;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gladly accepted my challenge. We decided to not complicate anything – a duel at midday the following day, a pair of daggers our only weapons. The first person to draw blood would be the winner.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6908;I am ready.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6908_TT;The challenge is about to begin.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [From.GetFirstName]'s throat, [From.GetSheHe] laughed heartily. ' A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [From.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [From.GetHerHis] arm. [From.GetFirstName]'s body shook as [From.GetSheHe] laughed underneath me. 'A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_C;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I did not remember when we had lost our weapons. Now we were wrestling on the ground, neither of us getting enough of an advantage, sweat soaking our clothes and stinging our eyes. 'Draw?' I breathed. 'Alright, draw,' [From.GetFirstName] chuckled in response.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_D;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Impressive disguise, [From.GetSocietyRank]. I mean it,' [From.GetFirstName] chuckled and gave me a hearty pat on the back.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_E;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [From.GetFirstName] lunged and nicked my arm as we fell. 'Good match, [From.GetSocietyRank],' [From.GetSheHe] chuckled and rolled over on [From.GetHerHis] back.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6903;We should do this again, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6903;[From.GetFirstName], you... you are marvelous.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6903_TT;You realize that you had a crush on §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! all along and profess your feelings.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6903;Now we both know who the best is.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6903_TT;Tell your fellow assassins about how you won over §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6904_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [From.GetFirstName]'s throat, [From.GetSheHe] cursed my name.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6904_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [From.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [From.GetHerHis] arm. [From.GetFirstName] cursed me loudly as [From.GetSheHe] pushed my body of [From.GetHerHis].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6904;Who is the master now, you [GetRootFromInsult]!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6904_TT;Punish §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6904;I am bigger than this.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_6904_TT;Now that you have won over §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!, go back to ignoring [From.GetHerHim].\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6905_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Who laughs now, [Root.GetFirstName]?' [From.GetFirstName] whispered before slashing the dagger across my shoulder.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6905_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [From.GetFirstName] lunged and slashed the blade across my dagger hand with a triumphant shout.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6905;I will kill that [GetRootFromInsult]!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_A;I could read [From.GetFirstName]'s answer in [From.GetHerHis] eyes as soon as the words had escaped my lips and my heart sank like a stone. It took [From.GetHerHim] a moment to recollect [From.GetHerselfHimself]. 'I am flattered, [From.GetFirstName]. Really, I am. But... I do not feel the same way. I'm sorry. Let us be friends?';x
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_B;For a moment, the world stood still. I could not breathe. Then the most radiant, heart-warming smile spread across [From.GetFirstName]'s [From.GetFaceDescription] face. 'I thought you would never ask, [Root.GetFirstName].';x
EVTOPTC_MNM_6907;I am honored to be your friend, [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_6907;I... I don't think I can do that.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_6922_C;A while ago, I noticed the frail nature of my superior, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. People whisper about the [GetRootFromInsult], but no one has dared to draw any attention to the matter. However, for all [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] knows, maybe there is a plot in the workings! I could blackmail [From.GetHerHim] to get what I want.;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_6922;I want some of his influence.;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_6922;I will win [From.GetHerHis] trust by a promise to be on [From.GetHerHis] side.;x

They will come for me, any day now. Being one of [Root.Society.GetName] always felt worth the risk, but I am not so sure anymore...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_10020_B;Some days, I think I am going insane. It is probably all in my head, but sometimes I notice people staring at me.

EVTDESC_MNM_3502;The last few months have been tough, so when I was invited to the home of [From.GetTitledFirstName] for a small ceremony, it felt like a gift from [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName].

EVTDESC_MNM_20049;[FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] and I staged a lavish feast in the abode of the dead [FromFromFrom.Religion.GetPriestTitle], taking care to only invite dignitaries who weren't well acquainted. The guests were shocked at the dancers, the half-naked musicians and the heady smoke from exotic 'incense', but when we brought in the prostitutes half the guests stood up and left – the other half were delighted!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20049;What will people think of your servants now, [From.Religion.GetHighGodName]!?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20052;My compatriot in the recent escapade to [FromFromFrom.GetName], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], seems to have played a prank on me. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] appears to have told [local_ruler.GetTitledName] that I was behind the rabble rousing.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20052;We'll see who gets the last laugh, [From.GetFirstName]...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20053;I just learned that my neighbor, [From.GetTitledName], has been stirring up the rabble in [local_province.GetName] with heretical nonsense!;x

EVTDESC_MNM_20061;My nights are plagued by terrible nightmares featuring the vile [dw_buddy.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber], my rival [dw_buddy.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType]. [dw_buddy.GetSubjectPronounCap] howls and roars at me to the tune of infernal bagpipes while [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] looks on, bellowing with laughter. I am sure that [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is sending me these dreams for a reason... I must prove myself worthy or be discarded as a weakling – such is the way of [Root.Society.GetName].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20061;Invite [dw_buddy.GetFirstName] over for some fun...;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_20061;No, dreams are just meaningless nonsense.;x
EVT_TT_20062;[This.GetSubjectPronounCap] will think this is an offer of reconciliation, but I'll have [This.GetObjectPronoun] scream for real...;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_20062;Pretend to walk into this trap...;x
EVT_TT_20064;My treacherous rival is in for a very nasty surprise!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20063;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], declined my offer to lay our differences aside and have some harmless fun together. The [GetRootFromInsult] must have sensed my true intentions...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20063;Damnation!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20064;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] arrived for our meeting, my servants threw a sack over [From.GetObjectPronoun] and beat the [GetRootFromInsult] into submission. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is now snugly stowed into a brazen bull that I had built especially for this occasion. Surrounding the bull are some crucified scum from my dungeon, drenched in oil.\n\nIt took some work to find three genuinely insane musicians, but as they start up their demented tune and the fires are lit underneath the bull, I lean back and realize it was all worth it. As soon as the first bellows start issuing forth from the bull, I order the human candles lit. I close my eyes and hum along with the infernal choir, my nightmares conquered once and for all...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20064;These are the pleasures that await us all in Hell!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20065;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone suddenly threw a sack over me and I was mercilessly pummeled until I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was hogtied and lying on the cold ground. My blindfold was roughly pulled off and I beheld a great brazen bull with firewood stacked underneath! Hooded characters forced me inside, with my mouth near a funnel of some kind. The hatch closed and soon I could hear demented music and chanting as the bull started to heat up. Please, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forgive me. Save my soul!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_20065;AAARRGH! AAAAH!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_20067;As [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone threw a sack over me and knocked me about a bit. Playing along with the charade, I was whisked away and switched for another bundled up victim...\n\nLater, I watched from the shadows as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] staged a demented musical ritual. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] had brought an actual brazen bull, just like the one built for the Tyrant of Akragas in ancient times. Believing me to be inside, the [GetRootFromFromInsult] ordered the flames lit. With the bull heating up, oil was poured over a bunch of crucified prisoners and set on fire – human candles screaming in accompaniment to the bellows issuing forth from the bull. The fool never realized [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] was cooking [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] own [GetFromFromVsFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName]!;x

EVTNAME_MNM_9601;Andvari's Gift;x
#EVTDESC_MNM_9601;Still dressed in traveler's garb, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] enters your throne room and kneels before you. Looking rather pale and a bit sickly, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] produces a small object, placing it gingerly in the palm of your outstretched hand.\n\n'Andvari's Gift... The Andvaranaut, my liege...' [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] whispers reverently. 'It must be. Its power is undeniable – it has already brought me many riches on the road back to the court.' You nod solemnly in response. Though it feels light in your hand, you already feel the burden on your soul. This ring must have enormous power, but you remember hearing in legends the curse that lies upon it...\n\nRegardless, with this find [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has truly surpassed [relic_hunter.GetHerselfHimself]!;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9602;The Hammer of the Thundergod;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9602;Proudly, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] strides into your throne room.

Kneeling before it, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] solemnly proclaims: 'I have recovered the hammer of Thor, the Thundergod, himself!'\n\nAs you reach down for it you notice that it looks strange – unlike any craftsmanship you have encountered in your realm thus far. The haft is obviously shorter than it was intended to be, and as your fingers touch it is not hard to convince yourself of the surge of power coursing through your body. Surely this means you were meant to wield it!\n\nLooking up, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] still waits for you to speak...;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9603;The Fetish of Souls;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9603;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] long travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes up to you and pulls out a small, carefully-wrapped package from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] clothes. With an awe-struck gaze [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] removes the cloth wrapping and reveals a piece of strangely-formed bark.\n\n'I have found the spirits of our ancestors...' [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] whispers reverently, handing it to you. Turning it the right way up, you immediately understand what [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] means. The bark has clearly taken the shape of not just one, but three distinct visages, each staring ominously into your soul. You can sense the connection with your forebears... And the power they no doubt offer you over others.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has truly proven [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] worth today.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9604;The Mill of Fortune;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9604;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] gently places a large box on the floor before you. As [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] men proceed to break it open, a single gold coin rolls falls to the floor through one of the box's widening cracks. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] picks it up and hands it to you, smiling brightly. 'I have found you the Mill of Fortune!'\n\nIn the opened box you see a very well-made quern, and your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] continues [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] explanation. 'This is not the first time we have found coins near the Sampo on our way back here. Flour and salt, too... It seems one's fortunes increase just by being near it.'\n\nRolling the coin on your knuckles you ponder the importance of this find. [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] may have found you the means to create wealth from nothingness itself...;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9605;The Axe of Perun;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9605;The gathering of thick thunderclouds overhead accompanies [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName]'s' return to your court, and, drenched, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] kneels before you in your throne room, holding up a large axe for you in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] hands. 'The axe, my [Root.GetLordLady], of Perun Himself...'\n\nAs you rise and step towards [relic_hunter.GetHerHim], you see the axe's fine quality, and the bolts of lightning clearly visible on the sides of the axe-head. You reach for it, and just as you grab hold and lift it from your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s hands a thunderclap can be heard in the distance. Surely this is a good omen!\n\nHolding the imposing axe as if you were born to it, you look down at the awe-struck [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] who brought it to you...;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9606;The Axe of Perkunas;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9606;A proud [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] enters your throne room, a huge weapon on [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] shoulder. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] bows, and when [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] holds out the weapon you see it is a huge two-handed axe, the head of which is crafted out of stone... 'My search has been long and difficult,' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says, 'but what I bring you can be no other than the axe wielded by Perkunas himself!'\n\nYou take the axe and inspect it. It does indeed bear a striking resemblance to the description you've heard of it, from legend. It feels heavy and powerful in your hands, and though it might not be the perfect weapon in combat you definitely exude an air of authority around you while you wield it...\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle], at least, seems impressed, as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] waits for you to speak.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9607;The Yada Tashy;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9607;Paired with a brief, but heavy downpour, a drenched [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] lengthy travels. Once in your presence, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] produces a small box, and opens it to reveal a beautiful, strange stone. With a broad smile [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] hands it to you. 'This... This stone is the Rain Stone... The Yada Tashy. It must be! Rain has followed our every step...'\n\nYou hold the stone in your hand, and ponder the earlier downpour's sudden onset. It makes sense! And with this stone, your lands' crops are all but assured to grow well. Other than the obvious benefit in food production, this should also make you more popular among your subjects.\n\nThe [relic_hunter.GetManWoman] who made it possible smiles at your elation, waiting patiently...;x

EVTDESC_MNM_9804;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find a powerful artifact. Holding a small metal box, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] appears before you and, bowing, offers it to you. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I have searched far and wide, and have found you the bones of Saint Peter, himself!'\n\nOpening the box to sate your curiosity, you indeed find the aged bones and skull of a man, packed in the small space of the container. Properly protected from the elements, it is likely that they will continue to survive for a long time to come. And so long that they do, they will be sure to improve the Christian world's disposition towards you.\n\nSeemingly expecting for you to speak, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently before you.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9805;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an intriguing piece of clothing. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] gives me a seamless, finely-woven tunic, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] claims is none other than the one Jesus wore before his crucifixion!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9806;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small, ornate metal box.

EVTDESC_MNM_9807;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box, within which lies a single, large, old-looking nail.

EVTDESC_MNM_9808;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned carrying a small box. Inside it I find a small piece of preserved skin, which my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures is none other but the prepuce of Jesus himself!;x

[relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] ensures me that it belonged to a saint, and that therefore it is most prestigious to possess it.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9810;The Staff of the Sixth Day;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9810;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing a seemingly ordinary shepherd's staff. Holding it delicately, and clearly treating the simple object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'I have found you the staff held by Moses, which split the Red Sea and produced water from naught but rock.'\n\nIndeed, once you hold it is not hard to recognize it for the remarkable object that it is. Created by God Himself on the Sixth Day of Creation, he who holds it is sure to have God's favor!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the staff's potential power creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9811;The Harp of God's Musician;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9811;Followed by one of [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] men, who carefully carries a beautiful harp, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] long search. With a broad smile, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] gives a sign for the man to hand you the instrument.\n\n'What you hold in your hands, my [Root.GetLordLady], is what I have determined to be the actual harp played by King David, himself.' Running your fingers over the strings, the sound is almost divine! To have a talented musician play this instrument would undoubtedly put even the most cantankerous of visitors in a good mood.\n\nYou highly doubt it would work on [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] if you made [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] leave without a reward, though...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9814;Upon [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] return, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands me a small jewelry box within which lies a small, engraved, brass and iron signet ring.

EVTDESC_MNM_9824;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box within which lies an ancient piece of parchment – a letter addressed to an ancient foreign ruler.

The significance of this find sinks in as you hold the cup and listen to your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s words... Properly utilized in a ritual of divination, this cup could indeed, if the legends are to be believed, provide you with the answers to many questions.\n\nAfter a short while you realize [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] is still waiting...;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9831;The Babr-e Bayan;x

#emerald_tablet_desc;Said to be written by Hermes Trismegistus himself, the Emerald Tablet is supposed to hold the secret of the prima materia and its transmutation. Someone who succeeds in deciphering its divine glyphs is one step closer to enlightenment and eternal life.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1418;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy [Root.GetSisterBrother], I have a proposal which might interest you. An old letter detailing the possible locations of some lost hermetic writings came into my possession not many moons ago. If you fund an expedition, we can search for these treasures together!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTDESC_MNM_1420_A;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe letter mentioned three lost texts: a tome in a local antiquary, a scroll hidden in a [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship] in [temple_site.GetName], and a tablet in the ancient library ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] in [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The further we venture, in distance as well as into the past, the greater secrets we might uncover. The choice is yours.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTDESC_MNM_1420_B;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have the best of news! Since our last correspondence I have acquired a map leading to a surviving chamber of the great library in Alexandria! While the previous options remain – a tome here in [Root.Capital.GetName], a scroll in [temple_site.GetName] and tablet in [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] – I would argue that this opportunity is too great to pass up.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1420;Excellent indeed! We shall go to Alexandria!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1420_TT;You and §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! set off on an expedition to Alexandria, hoping to find the ruins of the Great Library.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1420;Let us travel to the ruins in [ruin_site.GetName].;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1420_TT;You and §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! set off on an expedition to [ruin_site.GetName], hoping to find a tablet in the ruins there.\n;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1420;It seems like the best option is the scroll in [temple_site.GetName].;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1420_TT;You and §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! set off on an expedition to [temple_site.GetName], hoping to find a scroll in a [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship] there.\n;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1420;I do not have much to spare... Surely the local antiquary will do?;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1420_TT;You and §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and set off to a local antiquarian in search for an old tome.\n;x
EVTOPTX_MNM_1420_SUCCESS;a successful search.\n;x
EVTTITLE_MNM_1422;Tabula Smaragdina;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1422;When we found the engraved door to the chamber, we could hardly believe our eyes. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I had nearly given up. That day would be the very last of our search, we had decided, so our discovery must surely have been a divine miracle! My hands were shaking as I, alongside the servants, cleared the last rubble and heaved the door open.\n\nLantern held high over our heads, my colleague and I entered first. The faint light fell on countless pots and chests, elaborate wall paintings and a great forge. Something else reflected the light from deep within the chamber, something vibrantly green... [From.GetFirstName]'s breaths were quick and shallow. 'It.... it cannot be!';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1422;Finally, the deepest secrets of Hermes Trismegistus shall be mine!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1423;Our expedition into foreign lands encountered some difficulties, but in the end we made it to the ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] safely. After a fortnight of excavation the servants uncovered the entrance to a hidden underground chamber. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I entered side by side, the air heavy with excitement.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1423;Do my eyes deceive me, or are those symbols hieroglyphs?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1424;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship]. We examined every nook and cranny for clues of the scroll's hiding place. On the fifth day, one of the servants announced [Root.GetSheHe] had found a hidden chamber...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1424;We found it, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1425;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days on end we did nothing but breathe dust and leaf through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! On the fourth day, I was thus incredibly surprised to lay my eyes on the symbols of the Three Primes!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1425;I think I found the tome, [From.GetFirstName]!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_A;My misgivings arose early after our arrival in Alexandria, but [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] insisted that we must have misinterpreted the map. After every failure, [From.GetSheHe] had a new idea. A suspicion crept upon me... What if the map was forged, and [From.GetFirstName] knew? Was the blasted expedition a plot to ruin me?!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_B;Our expedition into foreign lands certainly encountered its fair share of difficulties. We dealt with everything from unfavorable weather to lame horses, but in the end, the fraudulent guide was the nail in the coffin. When [Root.GetSheHe] escaped with our last gold, we also discovered that we were in the wrong part of [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_C;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship]. We examined every nook and cranny for clues of the scroll's hiding place. After a week of nothing more interesting than the discovery of a stash of lewd letters, we had to admit defeat.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_D;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop. For days at end we did nothing but breathe dust and page through boring old texts. They were all full of nonsense! After a week, we had to admit defeat. We would never uncover anything of worth in this place.;x
quest_hermetics_find_text;Find a Hermetic Text;x
quest_hermetics_find_text_desc;Your colleague [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has found a letter detailing the possible locations of some great old works of Hermeticism. A deal has been struck – [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] shall share the contents of the letter with you, and you shall fund the expedition.;x
quest_hermetics_find_text_tooltip;If §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! sets out on one of the expeditions suggested by §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and finds an old hermetic text, the mission is completed.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_A;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a pompous, featherbrained scoundrel – you know it to be true, [Root.GetSisterBrother]! It is time for [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] to pay for [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] sins. Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_B;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy friend, we have a common nemesis. You know of whom I speak – the despicable idiot [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]! The thought of [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] being a member of our respectable community... it makes me sick! Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTDESC_MNM_1431_C;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a greedy, slothful idiot who deserves none of the riches in [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] possession. What do you say, [Root.GetSisterBrother] – shall we raid [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and claim that which should be ours?\n\nAs above, so below.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
quest_hermetics_infiltrate_laboratory;Infiltrate the Laboratory of [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];x
quest_hermetics_infiltrate_laboratory_desc;The greedy and paranoid [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName] guards [FromFrom.GetHerHis] secrets jealously. A most shameful behavior, indeed! Unlike [FromFrom.GetHerHim], you know how to share. In the spirit of collaboration, you and a colleague has agreed to infiltrate [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s laboratory and either steal or destroy anything of value. Perhaps you will do both!;x
quest_hermetics_infiltrate_laboratory_tooltip;Your colleague will bring you to the laboratory of §Y[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]§!. If you manage to steal or destroy anything and get away unnoticed, the mission is completed.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1433;Most esteemed [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYet my spies have not found the exact location of [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory. You need not worry, friend, for they have some promising leads. We will just have to be patient.\n\nAs above, so below.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1433;I shall prepare for a swift departure.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1433_TT;As soon as the spies of §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! has located the laboratory, you will depart.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_A;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] must be paranoid, for [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory is a fortress hidden away on a remote island. As we cross the dark waters under the cover of night, [From.GetFirstName] tells me about the guard rotation. We will only have one chance to breach the defenses.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_B;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] has hidden [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory deep in the dungeons of [infiltration_target.Capital.GetName]. [From.GetFirstName] and I have passed unnoticed so far thanks to the intelligence [From.GetHerHis] spies provided, but the last door is heavily guarded.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1435_C;It was not hard to locate [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory, [From.GetFirstName] tells me as we enter the [infiltration_target.Capital.GetHolding]. 'While old [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] has no talent for keeping secrets, [infiltration_target.GetSheHe] does know how to hire proper guards,' [From.GetSheHe] continues, telling me about the obstacle ahead.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1435;I have a way with people and a heavy purse.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1435_TT;Attempt to bribe the guards.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1435;I prepared a potion of dreamless sleep for this very eventuality.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1435_TT;Attempt to drug the guards with a potion of your own making.\n;x
EVTOPTX_MNM_1435_SUCCESS_TT;a successful scheme.;x
EVTOPTX_MNM_1435_FAIL_TT;a failed scheme and detection.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1435;You distract them, and I will enter the laboratory.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1435_TT;§Y[infiltration_companion.GetTitledFirstName]§! attempts to distract the guards. You will have to perform any theft or sabotage yourself once inside, which limits the amount of damage you may accomplish.\n;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1435;Actually, I have changed my mind...;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1435_TT;This is a bad idea. You retreat to the safety of your [Root.Capital.GetHolding].\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1436_A;As we step out of the shadows, the guards draw their blades. Their posture and faces change as I pull the heavy purse from my pocket. After a short exchange of words and coins, [infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I enter through the heavy door. 'What now, [Root.GetSisterBrother]? What course of action would you recommend?';x
EVTDESC_MNM_1436_B;By some miracle, [infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] manages to empty the little vial of potion in a jug before it is brought to the guards. Within a quarter of an hour, they are snoring softly. 'We must hurry – the sedating effect won't last forever,' I whisper as we sneak past. 'What now, [Root.GetSisterBrother]?' [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] asks once we are inside.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1436;If you focus on destruction, I will search for items of value.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1436_TT;You split up to cover more ground. Effective, but riskier.\n;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1436;Let me take care of sabotage. Collect anything useful you come across.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1436;Help me find where [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] keeps [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] valuables.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1436_TT;You stay together. Safer, but not as effective.\n;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1436;Our goal is maximum damage. Let's get started!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1437;First, everything went so well. By some miracle, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] managed to empty the little vial of potion in a jug before it was brought to the guards. That was half an hour ago! The guards are showing no signs of drowsiness and our time is running out. I whisper apologies as we leave, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] does not answer.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1437;That recipe never failed me before, I swear...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1438;I had my doubts, but color me impressed! [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] managed to lure the guards away by setting off an alchemical reaction producing the foulest of odors! While the trick was effective, to say the least, I do not know how much time I have. I need to focus. What should I do next?;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1438;I shall steal [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s rarest ingredients and most secret tomes!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1438;My focus will be maximum destruction. Where is the fire steel...?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1439;I have seen many foolish things in my days, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]'s poor attempt at a distraction might just take the prize. I am dumbstruck as [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] rattles [infiltration_companion.GetHerHis] blade against the wall and begins to wail loudly! When the guard's footsteps draw near, I grab [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim] and run. 'Really, a ghost? No one in their right mind would fall for that!';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1439;There will be no second attempt tonight. Not in a long, long time.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_A;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the sleeping potion, they are still faster than me.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_B;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_C;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the potion, they are still faster than me.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1440_D;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1440;Release me! I'm a colleague of your [infiltration_target.GetMasterMistress]!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1451;It seems like my guards have caught a couple of ugly fishes! Apparently [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName], along with [From.GetHerHis] accomplice [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName], made an attempt to enter my laboratory and steal my secrets. This insult cannot go unanswered...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1451;Perhaps [From.GetFirstName] is willing to trade a few secrets for [From.GetHerHis] freedom.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1451;Leave them in the dungeon. I will deal with them later...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1451_FAIL_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! refuses to share [From.GetHerHis] secrets and stays imprisoned.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1452;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed!' After some further insults, [From.GetSheHe] offers me my freedom in exchange for some of my deepest secret knowledge.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1452;Give me some water and then I will tell you whatever you wish to know.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1452;You will never be worthy of my secrets!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1452_TT;You stay imprisoned.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1453;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. I am sure I could have asked for [From.GetHerHis] firstborn, so eager was [From.GetSheHe] to have [From.GetHerHis] freedom. [From.GetFirstName] filled notebook after notebook under my stern gaze.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1453;This will be an interesting read, indeed.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1454;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] cell, however, for when I told [From.GetHerHim] of my generous offer, I got nothing but insults and curses in return.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1454;Enjoy your beloved cell, [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1455;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed! I just wanted to have a look at you before they throw away the key...';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1455;Mercy, mercy! I can't return to that place!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_A;Who knew the laboratory of [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] would be such a treasure trove? In addition to some rare ingredients and a few items which will fetch good coin in the shadier parts of [Root.Capital.GetName], I came across a most interesting text!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_B;My search has been most rewarding. [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s ingredient cabinet has a fine assortment of substances and I have found several nuggets of precious metal. My share of the spoils will be a fine addition to my own laboratory!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1441_C;For all [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] talk and boasting, I expected more than this. Or, perhaps, [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is more paranoid than I thought. In any case, I cannot find anything of great value. At least these nuggets of metal will sell for a few coins.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1441;An excellent find! Praise Hermes!;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1441;It is better than nothing, I guess.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_A;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only have my ingredient cabinet and metal collection been pilfered, but my most valued text is gone! My most divine knowledge, my deepest secrets! May the thief rot in hell!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_B;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only has the thief laid its dirty hands on my precious metals, but my ingredient cabinet has been ransacked also. The culprit must be another follower of the Hermetic arts!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1442_C;I should really look over the security of my lab. Last night, some vile person snuck past the guards, but luckily nothing of major value was stolen. Either the thief had no idea of how valuable my ingredients and tomes are, or they were too dumb to find them. The precious metals will cost a fair bit to replace, though.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_A;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] gunpowder better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent bomb. Considering the many barrels of volatile substances, this should be enough to ruin the laboratory. I light the fuse and run.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_B;Thankfully, a laboratory is not particularly hard to sabotage. The place is full of acids, volatile substances and old tomes dry as bones. While I do not feel confident enough to risk a great fire, I heave the texts into the furnace and set the ablaze!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1443_C;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] gunpowder better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent bomb. I assemble the parts ever so slowly because my hands will not stop shaking. Just as I am about to perform the last step, I drop a vial. I freeze.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1443;BOOM!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1443;Excellent! It will take [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] months, if not years, to recover!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_A;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! I woke last night as the whole keep shook violently. It seems like someone entered my laboratory and set off an explosion! Luckily, no lives were harmed, but my laboratory is in ruins. There is nothing to save.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_B;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! It seems as if I have made an enemy, for the intruder focused on destruction rather than theft. Acid has been poured on floors and across work surfaces, pots and glass have been shattered and, worst of all, my furnace is filled with the blackened pages of burnt books!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_C;I am not sure whether I should be disturbed or amused! This morning, a charred corpse was discovered in my laboratory. Apparently the crook broke in to sabotage my work but managed to kill [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a botched attempt to craft a bomb. I examined the body and the culprit was none other than [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.Society.GetName]!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1444;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] punishes the sinful.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_A;I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] hands deep in a big ingredients chest. Our eyes meet and I nod. It is time to go. [From.GetFirstName] stuff a few more vials and nuggets of metal into [From.GetHerHis] satchel before running after me.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_B;I follow the trail of overturned chests and broken vials until I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. I gesture for [From.GetHerHim] to come with me – it is time to go. [From.GetSheHeCap] stuffs [From.GetHerHis] pockets with a few nearby tools before running after me.;x
#EVTOPTA_MNM_1467;So, what is my share of the spoils?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1448;As I close my satchel, I hear a loud crash from the other room. As I peek through the doorway, the scene before me is impressive. The warm light of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s torch illuminates the destruction. Overturned tables, torn books and smashed instruments. I nod appreciatively. 'It is time to leave.';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1448;I wish I could see [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s face when [infiltration_target.GetSheHe] realizes what we've done!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1449;As I reach for a nearby tome, a terrifying roar sweeps through the laboratory and the floor shudders underneath my feet. Images of dragons and chimeras flash through my mind before the truth hits me. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] must have set of an explosion. There is no time look for [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1449;No one could have slept through that. I have to run!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1450;Once we have left the laboratory far behind us, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I collapse, two bundles of sweaty and shivering limbs. We did it. We really did it, and we got away with it, too! As the laugh erupts from my lips, my body finally relaxes. Next to me, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] heavy breathing turns into a merry chuckle.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1450;We really showed [infiltration_target.GetHerHim], didn't we?;x

EVTDESC_MNM_1201_BATTLE_C;I concentrate for a long time, staring into the water. I almost have time to doubt myself, but then I see it: faint ripples, a shadow, then two. It looks like a fire, and a sword.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_A;I see... A still pond of water. It is... quiet.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_B;At first, all I the water shows me is the reflection of the ceiling. I shake my head. I have to look beyond the material world! I close my eyes, and when I open them again, I see it clearly.\nA bed of flowers, and an urn.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1201_RELATIONSHIP_C;I am at first not sure what to make of the strange shape. Maybe I am imagining it, or maybe it is a shadow. Does it matter? I see it clearly: a familiar silhouette, standing under a moon.;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_1476;Eureka!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1476_TT;You have an epiphany which will greatly contribute to the project.\n;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_A;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished!

EVTOPTA_MNM_1478;The enemy will fear to meet me on the battlefield!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_B;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished!

It will surely give an advantage to our traders.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1478;The sun and stars hold many truths, but so does our compass!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_C;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! We have designed and constructed an ingenious device to measure angles in the sky.

EVTOPTC_MNM_1478;The secrets of the heavens shall be unveiled!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_D;The hour has finally arrived. Today we test our invention! Together we have devised a huge crossbow which launches large stones. While the weapon is certainly deadly, it is also incredibly intimidating. I will have one mounted on the walls of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1478;Only the bravest and the most foolish soldiers would dare crossing its trajectory.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_E;Together my colleagues and I have constructed a huge furnace of a truly ingenious design!

EVTOPTE_MNM_1478;We are masters of metal, my friends!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_F;The invention is finished! Together we have created our own secret code as well as an instrument to aid in enciphering and deciphering.

EVTOPTF_MNM_1478;Now we may safely share our ideas and discoveries with each other.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_G;Our invention has been completed. While it is not a weapon, it will offer protection from them. It is a set of armor consisting of several big plates of metal instead of the common mail. The design we have arrived at also allows for impressive mobility.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_1829;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nDear colleague, throughout my studies, I have found the most fascinating phenomena from observing the sky. I am of the firmest belief that the foundation of the cosmos is hiding somewhere out there.

EVTDESC_MNM_1840;This has certainly been a very productive evening. I have been able to dedicate all of my thinking to calculate the patterns of the different objects in the sky uninterrupted.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1840;Everything is so clear now.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1840;I should always strive to be this productive.;x
EVTOPTC_MNM_1840;Studying the vast sky gives me new perspectives.;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_1840;I've found a new meaning in my life.;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1841;My [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] expressed a curious notion, over supper this evening. "I miss your conversation, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [target_spouse.GetFirstName] said, taking another sip of [target_spouse.GetHerHis] drink. "It's all astronomical phenomenon with you these days...! Surely, you could take some nights off from your research?";x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1841;Dining with my [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife], the topic of my research came up again. I told [target_spouse.GetHerHim] that I of course regret any ill feelings [target_spouse.GetSheHe] might be experiencing from it, but that I am doing important work. "Honestly, I grow weary of defending myself!", I snapped in the end.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1841_1;One does not simply take a break from this task.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1841_1;Of course, I will spend more time with you, [target_spouse.GetFirstName].;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_1841_2;You are right, [target_spouse.GetFirstName], I will change my priorities.;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1842;I am in the middle of adjusting my new sextant, having just spotted what looked like a shooting star, when there is a faint knock on my door. Opening it, I find my [target_child.GetSonDaughter] [target_child.GetFirstName] fidgeting nervously. Hesitantly, [target_child.GetSheHe] speaks: "[Root.GetFatherMother]? I... I can't sleep.";x
#EVTOPTA_MNM_1842;I don't have time for this! Just wake the cook, have him make you a snack.;x

EVTOPTB_MNM_1843;Some duties can't be neglected.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1844;[target_friend.GetTitledFirstName] has been very cold to me lately. When I approach [target_friend.GetHerHim] about it today, [target_friend.GetSheHe] asks me point blank where I was. "Was when?", I respond. "We had plans to visit my uncle? The one who likes fishing? I knew you weren't all that excited, but I didn't expect you to simply not show up", [target_friend.GetSheHe] mutters.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1844;I.. I have had many important things on my mind, lately.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1844;I understand why you are upset, and I am so sorry, [target_friend.GetFirstName].;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1845;While in a meeting with my council, I feel a headache rising inside my skull, making it hard to pick up the different conversations in the room. Lack of sleep is clearly taking its toll on me. Shouting erupts in the room – suddenly [councillor1.GetTitledFirstName] shouts my name, bringing my consciousness back to the room. In a threatening tone, [councillor1.GetSheHe] asks if I agree.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1845;"Sure, sure...?";x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1845;"I'm sorry, would you care to explain the matter to me again?";x
EVTDESC_MNM_1846;My careful observations of [This.GetRandomPlanetName] has finally allowed me to conclude that the old projections of the planets path across the sky have been flawed. With some precise adjustments I can present a corrected projection.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1846;This will lead me closer to the truth behind the mysteries of the world.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1847;It is an early morning when I, with shaking hand, put my quill down... Is it possible? Have I predicted the traveling of a star-fall? Wiping my brow, I go over my calculations once more – I get the same results, again. It does seem to add up! I lean back in my chair – judging from all the signs, I am fairly certain I know when this marvel will take place.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1847;Come the night, I will gather a crowd to witness it with me!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1847;I should keep this to myself. Just in case I am wrong.;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1853;The air is crisp and the sky clear, as people huddle around each other to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise. As the hour begins to slip away, I hear their skeptical mumbling. Then, suddenly, several "Oooh!" and "Aaah!" take place around me, as people excitedly start pointing upwards. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1853;The air is crisp, as people gather together at top of the hill, to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise, and I am beginning to worry. Even if I am right, chances are the star-fall won't be visible tonight, as the weather is particularly cloudy. As the moments pass, one person leaves, and I hear people mumbling. The night grows colder. Eventually, I am left alone on the hill.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1853;This is a night we shall all remember.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1853;I am humiliated!;x
EVTDESCA_MNM_1854;The sky is pitch black and clear as I make my way up the hill. Carrying my instruments, I have a good feeling about my calculations – tonight is the night. I begin to unpack, and I am in the middle of adjusting my lenses, when I realize that the star-fall is visible even without my tools. I gasp, my chest filling with jubilant glee. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;x
EVTDESCB_MNM_1854;I have been camped out on the hill for hours, hoping against hope. Maybe I missed it? Maybe my instruments are too weak? I wait even longer, but eventually it dawns on me – I was wrong. I am not sure how, but there is no star-fall.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1854;This is what it's all about.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1854;How could I have been so wrong?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1848;I find myself almost buried under an enormous heap of documents occupying my work desk which I have carefully studied. Yet there is still an absence of any observation about the specific light in the sky between two well-known star formations.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1851;On a dark sheet there lies bright dots scattered around, dancing in a random fashion. No matter how long time I spend staring into the sky, no pattern reveals itself for me.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1851;There must be something wrong with my instruments.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1852;[From.GetBestName] has not only discovered a new bright star in the sky, [From.GetSheHe] has decided to give me the honor of having the sparkling star named after myself!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1852;Do I really deserve this honor?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1830;The instruments and tomes that I had to gather for my studies of the secrets behind the stars have finally arrived. Lenses of different shapes and sizes, together with dusty old tomes written by learned people – these will prove invaluable for uncovering the truth.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1830;Now I can carefully observe the sky.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1850;It is rare to have a completely clear night-sky to observe, yet tonight the weather conditions are perfect. I smile, as I begin to carefully note down the pattern of the celestial bodies. I feel a surge of energy – never have I had such a spectacular view of my own constellation, [Root.GetWesternZodiacSign] – I can sense my connection to the elements stronger than ever before.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1850;How exhilarating!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_5100;Being at the debate is a draining process. I have not had a good night's sleep since I got here.

EVTOPTB_MNM_1900;Alchemy and spiritual transformation.;x

EVTDESCB_MNM_1901;To study alchemy and how to reach spiritual transformation is indeed a learning experience. Albeit more difficult than one might imagine. But time has come to also master the other arts. Which one should be my focus?;x
EVTDESCC_MNM_1901;I have attained great knowledge in the art of Theurgy. Learning about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and divine spirits. Yet, to master the truth and understand it, I will need to learn more about the other arts. Which one should I study next?;x

EVTOPTA_MNM_1905;So much to learn. So little time.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1906;One way to better understand [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is the use of white magic, in which you pray to divine spirits in order to use their guidance. This is known as Theurgy. Another path is that of Goetia. To use black magic by seeking out foul demons and heeding their advice.;x

EVTDESC_MNM_1930;When arriving in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName] I was greeted with a smile from [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName]. I quickly unpacked but I could tell that [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] was eagerly waiting for me. 'I would like to show you my observatory', [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] said as [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] was turning to lead the way. Once inside, carefully crafted tools and lenses could be seen everywhere.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1930;This is truly impressive!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1930;I fail to see the magnificence really.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1931;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] the way to the observatory. When we stepped inside, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] gazed in wonder at the various tools. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] went on to ask about the different instruments and how to use them. At which times you are more likely to see the stars more clearly. The questions kept coming for quite a while.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1931;I am glad [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] liked it!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1932;I lead [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the observatory and waited for [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] reaction when we stepped inside. At first [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only looked around. After a while [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] asked a few simple question but I got the feeling that it was not very impressive.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1932;Oh well. We are here to study after all.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1933;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] greeted me when I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. After a short conversation [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] lead the way to [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] study. When we stepped inside I immediately noticed all the tools and lenses. It would seem that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] owns quite a collection of stargazing equipment.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1933;Magnificent tools I must say.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1933;Anyone can acquire such common items, no?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1934;I guided [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the study to showcase my stargazing tools. I could see that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was delighted as [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] spent quite some time inspecting them. We talked about the tools for quite a while. We even had a long conversation just about lenses. Small lenses and larger lenses, and knowing when to use which ones.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1934;You may use them later tonight.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1935;I arrived at the study with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] closely behind me. 'This is the equipment I have obtained', I explained and gestured towards the neatly ordered collection of tools. [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] inspected the collection for a moment, but did not look very impressed. Or at least as something [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] has seen before.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1935;At least I like them.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1936;Upon my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName], I was received with great splendor. [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] explained that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] had chosen a perfect location to use during the night. 'This way and I will show it to you.' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] lead the way to a hill not too far away. The hill had a decent height for its small size and no trees obscuring the view.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1936;This will suit our needs perfectly!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1936;A lonely hill in the middle of nowhere...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1937;We walked to the hill of my choice not far away. Once there, [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] took a moment to look at the hill and the sky above. 'This hill should suit our needs perfectly I think.' [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] said while nodding approvingly. We quickly decided on where to set up in order to be able to see as much as possible.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1937;It is all about location, location, location.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1938;I walked with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the nearby hill I had chosen for us. While pointing to a few places that I think would work well for us, I hear [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] complaining behind me. Clearly disapproved of my choice. 'I suppose it will do. But it seems to be very far away if you ask me.';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1938;Trust me. It offers a better view.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1939;When I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName] I was not only met with a warm smile from [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], but a grand feast as well! A wide range of courses had been prepared for our pleasure and indulgence. [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] raised a cup in my honor. 'Let us toast for a night of new discoveries!';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1939;A spectacular feast I must say!;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1939;Is it not a bit excessive?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1940;When [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] entered the dining hall, I think the feast came as a surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. We dined and enjoyed ourselves and had a good time just speaking with each other for the next few hours. 'You have outdone yourself, [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]. This was spectacular!';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1940;The wonders of good food.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1941;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the dining hall and the awaiting feast. The look on [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] face made it abundantly clear that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was not expecting a proper feast. Perhaps [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was expecting a small dinner? Did I overdo it?;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1941;It tasted good at least.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1942;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was there to welcome me on my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. Shortly thereafter we made the way to [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]'s private study, where [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] began to show me his current work and most recent discoveries. 'How better to pass the time before nightfall than to spend it on studies and learning?';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1942;That is why I am here.;x
EVTOPTB_MNM_1942;Even learning is best in moderation.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1943;Knowing that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] is a learned man I showed him to my study. After discussing my most recently acquired writings I suggested that we sit down and try to learn something from them. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] responded with approval. 'I would never say no to an opportunity of gathering newfound knowledge. That is after all, the reason I am here.';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1943;Knowledge is power.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1944;Thinking that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] would jump at the chance of examining my most recently acquired writings, I showed [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim] my collection. After a moment of glancing through the pages, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] casually put the writings back in their place. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then suggested that we rest before the night.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1944;I presume the journey was long?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1945;Night is almost upon us and the first stars are finally making themselves visible on the sky outside. I should tell [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] that it is time. Time to see if we can uncover new secrets.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1945;We should get ready.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and me have been looking at the stars for a few hours already. Suddenly, it occurred to me. Stars are aligned in different patterns, taking on the shapes of different figures. But they are not really moving, are they? They always seem to have the same location in relation to one another.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! Take notes!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1948;I was reading through our notes when [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly shouted at me. '[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! It just occurred to me!' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] then went on explaining [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] theory about how the stars never move and how they are related to one another.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1948;[stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] could be on to something!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1950;I was writing down some notes when I heard [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] speak behind me and turned to face [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then went on to explain a theory of how the zodiacs are connected with each other how they are aligned in a certain way.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1950;Yes. Interesting thoughts.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1951;When looking at the stars and the patterns they create on the sky, I started thinking on the zodiacs. I quickly explained my newfound theory to [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] who nodded in agreement. The zodiacs are sure to be hiding secrets waiting to be unveiled.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1951;I am certain of it!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1953;After several hours of studying the stars, I saw it. A sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. I called for [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to get [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] attention. We both marveled at the beauty of it for a while. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] said after a moment of silence. I could only nod my head in agreement.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1953;It makes us seem so small.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1954;After several hours of studying the stars, we noticed a sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. Both me and [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] marveled at the beauty of it. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] nodded slowly in response. 'It is. But it is hardly an omen of the end times like the peasants would make you believe.';x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1954;No it is not. But it is beautiful.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1955;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and I have been taking turns in making observations and recording everything. I cannot say that we have made any significant discoveries so far. We have made some progress, however, and learned a few things we did not know before.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1955;The night is not over yet.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1957;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. Neither [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] nor I has made any noticeable progress so far. With most of the night gone already, it is unlikely that we will accomplish much more.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1957;What a disappointing night.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1958;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. But neither of us has been able to make any significant progress. Which is disappointing, to say the least. But I can see that my host, [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], is more disappointed than I am. [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] probably had very high hopes for the night.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1958;So did I.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1959;The sky was filled with ominously dark clouds already when we started our observations. As the hours drags on, it is only getting worse. You cannot see anything by now! Not a single star in sight! I suppose we might as well call it a night right here...;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1959;Curse this weather!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1962;After spending to night together with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName], I feel like we have become quite close. We seem to complement each other perfectly and the both of us are having a really good time!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1962;I have gained a new friend!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1963;Accepting the invitation to come here and spend the night studying with [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was the correct decision. I have not had this much fun talking to someone in quite a while. We seem to understand each other perfectly!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1963;Thank you my friend.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1965;This night seem to never end. I am wondering why I even invited [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] in the first place. Nothing I have done so far seem to please [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. Whenever I try to start a conversation to lighten the mood, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only answer with an obnoxious remark.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1965;I cannot wait for you to leave...;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1966;I should just have thrown away [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] invitation the moment it arrived. This night has been nothing short of horrible. Listening to [stargazing_host.GetHerHim] hurling one insult after the other. One might be thinking if that is the reason why [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] invited me here!;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1966;I have never been so offended!;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_A;Dawn is upon us as the first light appears on the horizon. I think we can agree that the night was an immense success. We took plenty of notes and learned a thing or two. Maybe we will have an opportunity to continue our combined research in the future?;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_B;An exhausting night finally ends. We worked throughout the entire night without any sort of noticeable progress at all. While it feels disappointing, I am confident that continued observations will yield superior results.;x
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_C;Time really do fly when you are having fun. We did not make any sort of noticeable progress in our attempted research. But the night was spent in good company, making it feel much less of a disappointment.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_A;Let us do this again sometime.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_B;Progress takes time.;x
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_C;Progress or not. I had a great time!;x

[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] has provided you all with a new, special type of incense that [From.GetSheHe] claims is necessary to make the eventual connection with the Divine Being. Before long it has permeated the air, and as you inhale more and more of it, hearing the drone of your fellows' chants, you feel your soul disconnect from your body and begin to ascend...\n\n...until it seems to connect with something. An... entity touches your soul, though you cannot perceive it with any senses other than your mind's eye. It must be the Divine Being! You have succeeded!

secret_religious_society_norse_pagan_desc;Knowing of the inevitable coming of Ragnarok, as foretold in their saga scriptures, Norse believers will work even in secret to prepare the world for the snowy hell of the Fimbulvetr and the great battles of all-consuming fire it presages. Practicing their secret rituals in the name of the Allfather, they will accept any kind of warrior who can stand with them in the struggle against the chaos and desolation that other faiths seem intent on bringing upon the world.;x
secret_religious_society_baltic_pagan_desc;As children of Dievas, the hidden followers of the Baltic faith know that everything is connected through the divine spirit, even those who oppress them. So it is that they continue their work unabated, spreading the words of the High Priest even among those who are at first unwilling to listen. Through the divine commonality of Perkunas, Saule or Daugava, they believe anyone can find a home with them.;x
secret_religious_society_finnish_pagan_desc;Even under the rule of another religion, the Suomenusko faith lives strong in some people.

The answer to every theological challenge and every moment of doubt is right in the sky above them, every day, without fail. It is what brings life and hope, deserving of every prostration.
