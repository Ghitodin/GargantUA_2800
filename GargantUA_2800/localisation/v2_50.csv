EVTTITLE_ZE_1011;The Disobedient Daughter;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1011;Your daughter [FromFrom.GetFirstName] comes to see you. She is very unhappy with the arranged marriage: '[Root.GetFatherMother] - I do not love my new husband and I will not accept this! I implore you to annul the marriage!';x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1011;You are not thinking straight, [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_1011;Very well, we shall not force you.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1012;As the wedding celebrations are being prepared, [From.GetTitledName] informs you that [From.GetHerHis] daughter will not accept marrying [target_spurned_spouse.GetTitledName], and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to annul the marriage!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1012;What? This is unheard of!;x
#EVTDESC_ZE_1031;Your daughter [FromFrom.target_daughter_killed_her_lover] is furious with you: 'Damn you, [Root.GetFatherMother] - you killed [From.GetFirstName], I will never forgive you!'.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1031;I didn't think you'd mind...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1120;There is a rumor among the servants that the tragedy which befell the late husband of your daughter [From.GetFirstName] was in fact caused by her. She supposedly poisoned him in his sleep.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1120;Who knows if such rumors are true?;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1130;You receive news that your daughter [From.GetFirstName], in a heated argument in the bedchamber, drew a sword and attacked and her spouse. He apparently managed to find a weapon to defend himself but she bested him in combat and killed him!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1130;Terrible, but... impressive!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1142;Your daughter, [From.GetFirstName], has eloped! Worse, she seems to have made friends abroad and has settled in a castle in the realm of [From.Owner.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1142;What? How...?;x
EVTTITLE_ZE_1150;The Mercenary Princess;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1150;Your daughter, [From.GetFirstName], has eloped, leaving her family and home behind! And you hardly believe your ears when you are told that she has banded up with scoundrels and criminals and formed a mercenary band, which she now leads!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1150;This is intolerable!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1180;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] comes to see you: '[Root.GetFatherMotherCap], I cannot abide your arbitrariness and tyranny, and your hypocritical abuse of the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] vexes me more than anything else. I spit on your religion and I turn my back on it!';x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1180;I have raised a blasphemer and heretic!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1190;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] could not abide her solitary and ignoble existence as a prisoner. Ever prone to choosing her own path, this time she has chosen to take her own life.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_1302;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] comes to see you: '[Root.GetFatherMotherCap], [target_daughter_wants_to_marry.GetFirstName] and I love each other, and I demand you allow us to marry.';x
EVTOPTA_ZE_1302;Of course my dear, if that is what you desire.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_1302;Do not ask such absurd things of me.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4000;Your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledName], has come to you with a suggestion: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], it is my opinion that [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetTitledNameWithNick] would make an excellent military commander. I suggest we make use of [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetHerHis] talents for the good of the realm.;x

EVTOPTA_ZE_5000;Your zeal does you credit. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] be with you.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_5000;Very well, if you insist.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_5000;No, I will not allow it.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_5010;My [Root.GetLordLady],\n\nI would like us to invest in building a great temple for the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].

EVTOPTA_ZE_5010;A great idea!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_5010;It would be a waste of money.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_5020;Strange news reach your ears. Apparently, one of your courtiers has converted to the [ze_5020_province.Religion.GetName] faith!;x

EVTDESC_ZE_5022;It seems another of your courtiers has converted to the [ze_5020_province.Religion.GetName] faith!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_5022;Something strange is going on here...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_5027;A number of incriminating letters have been found. They are from your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName] [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName], addressed to various members of your court, praising the simple virtues of the [Root.job_spiritual.Location.Religion.GetName]s and contrasting them with the tired, decadent ways of the [Root.Religion.GetName]s. This surely explains the recent outbreak of vile flirting with heathenry at your court!;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_5027;If this madness stops now, I shall forgive.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_5030;Your [Root.GetLordSpiritualName], [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledNameWithNick], has been discovered charging money for various religious favors, putting the gold in [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] own pocket.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_5030;Intolerable!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_5030;Disappointing, but understandable.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_5040;My [Root.GetTitle],\nI find life here among the heathens both wretched and dangerous, and I am convinced that they are both blind and deaf to the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. I plead with you to allow me to return home where I can do more useful work for the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.\n\nYour loyal servant,\n[Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_5040;Very well, I will recall [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_5040;The whining coward will be of no use there anyway.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_5040;[Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHeCap] must stay and do [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] duty.;x
#EVTDESC_ZE_4000;Your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledNameWithNick], has suggested that you appoint [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetTitledNameWithNick] to fill one of the vacant commander posts for your armies. [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] assures you that [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetTitledFirstName] would be the perfect [recommended_for_marshal_ze_4000.GetManWoman] for the job.;x
#EVTOPTA_ZE_4000;That is an excellent suggestion.;x
#EVTOPTB_ZE_4000;I think not.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4010;Your [Root.GetMarshalName], [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledName], has put forward a plan for experimentation with new military technology, inspired by a supposedly brilliant inventor and engineer that [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has recently befriended. All that is needed is a little funding...;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4010;You shall have it.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_4010;No, this is pointless.;x
EVTTITLE_ZE_4020;The Armored Chariot;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_4020;You receive a report from the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a large steel-plated chariot was constructed, propelled by ten men inside pulling it forward, directed by a commander peering out from a revolving turret mounted on top. This vehicle also had several ballistas firing through arrow slits. Though ending up being too slow (and expensive) for actual wartime employment, it still provided some valuable lessons.;x

Apparently, a large steel-plated chariot was constructed, propelled by ten men inside pulling it forward, directed by a commander peering out from a revolving turret mounted on top. This vehicle also had several ballistas firing through arrow slits. Unfortunately, its weight caused a wooden bridge to collapse when crossing and the invention was lost in the river, also killing the engineer. The [Root.GetMarshalName] [Root.job_marshal.GetHerselfHimself] barely escaped with [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] life.;x

EVTTITLE_ZE_4030;Screaming Arrows;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_4030;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a new kind of self-propelled arrow was tried out, based on Far Eastern models. Lit by fire, these arrows would scream and fly away leaving a trail of smoke and then explode on impact, killing several of the livestock used as practice targets. Though of dubious accuracy and prone to failure in rainy weather, these experiments have still provided some valuable lessons.;x

EVTTITLE_ZE_4040;Trumpets of Doom;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4040;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor. Apparently, the experiments consisted in training an large force of musicians to blow their trumpets in unison, thus deafening and stunning the enemy army in preparation for an attack.

Apparently, the experiments consisted in drenching a large amount of sheep in oil and setting fire to them, then sending the terrified, screaming animals towards the enemy. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to control the direction of the sheep. The engineer was immolated in a ball of fire and your [Root.GetMarshalName] barely escaped with [Root.GetHerHis] life.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_4050;It seems we'll be dining roast mutton...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_4100;You receive news of your [Root.GetMarshalName]'s activities in [Root.job_marshal.Location.GetName]. It appears [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] has been spreading ill words about your rule, encouraging disloyalty among the peasantry!;x

EVTDESC_ZE_2022;My [Root.GetChancellorName] [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName] kindly suggests that it would be of benefit to the realm if I studied the languages spoken at foreign courts. [language_teacher.GetSheHeCap] also offers [language_teacher.GetHerselfHimself] to aid me in my studies.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2022;An excellent idea!;x
EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2022;Studies begin.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2022;If they can't speak [Root.Culture.GetName] they are not important.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2024;Without the support of [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName], your study sessions seem to be few and far between. You increasingly feel that the challenge is just too great to tackle on your own.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2024;At least I made an effort.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2025;Your determination and hard work has paid off. Studying with [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName], you have learned several new languages to a decent level of fluency. This will surely increase your prestige at foreign courts!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2025;I knew I could do it!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2026;Distractions seem to overwhelm you during your studies. The simplest pleasures, and even plain and mundane chores, seem like time better spent than drowning in books all evening. How does one manage to keep focused when everything else is so much more appealing?;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2026;If I learn even a few phrases, it will be worth it!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2026;I guess learning languages is not for everyone.;x
EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2026;Language studies abandoned.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2027;[Root.GetChancellorName] [language_teacher.GetTitledFirstName] has a look of parental disappointment in [language_teacher.GetHerHis] eyes. 'I believe you could have done this well if only you'd put your mind to it. Unfortunately your disinterest is all too apparent in your absence from our meetings. With your permission, I will henceforth focus on more useful work instead of waiting for you, my Liege.';x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2027;You will watch your tongue or lose it!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2027;Although I learned less than expected, I thank you for your time.;x
opinion_unruly_spymaster;Unruly Spymaster;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2061A;Being a Council Member is a powerful, almost intimidating feeling. The authority, the impact of your decisions across the realm. Inside the circle of trust, so close to this unreal amount of money, one wonders - if some of the gold were to disappear, would anyone even notice?;x
#EVTDESC_ZE_2061B;The coffers are left open and unattended again. Surely, this is [liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s way of telling me that a small bonus is in order. [liege.GetSheHeCap] knows the other councillors would object if it were mentioned in their presence. ;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2061;I can take some, I deserve it.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2061;No, it's not right.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2062A;Curious, I was as pleased as always when I saw the amount of coin in the coffers this morning. But looking at it now, the amount seems somehow... less. Could it be that someone is stealing from me?;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2062B;Going through the treasury to account for today's earnings, it seems to me that the coffers seem to contain less than what we started out with today. Either someone is stealing my gold or I must be going mad.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2062;When I catch the thieving little rat...;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2062;First they take my gold, and then what?;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2063A;As you pass by the treasury, you stumble upon [From.GetTitledFirstName] digging through the coffers. You must have been quiet as [From.GetSheHe] looks very surprised. So this is where the missing gold has gone.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2063B;You close the door to your chamber, and as you approach your personal gold coffer you spot someone hiding behind it. A well aimed kick makes [From.GetTitledFirstName] squirm and the sound of what may be broken ribs accompanies [From.GetHerHis] scream of agony.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2063;Let [From.GetHerHim] go in exchange for a favor.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2063;This behavior is unacceptable.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2064;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName] [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] has also noticed that coins are missing but has concluded that your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledFirstName] is the only one that could've stolen it.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2064;Make [From.GetHerHim] swear to never do it again.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2064;Remove [From.GetHerHim] from the Council.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2065;I have been caught stealing from the coffers of my Liege. But [From.GetSheHe] has been kind enough to let me go with a warning. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that I owe [From.GetHerHim] a favor, however.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2065;That's fortunate.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2066;I was caught stealing from the coffers, but was fortunate enough to be let go with a warning.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2066;It could have been worse.;x
#EVTDESC_ZE_2075;I've received a request for additional funds from my [GetSpymasterName] [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName]. [Root.job_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] is worried that it is too easy for spies to make their way inside your home and wants to take precautionary measures against hostile operations.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2075;It can't hurt to be a little safer.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2075;It's too expensive.;x
EVTTOOLTIP_ZE_2075;Start to plan defences.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_2076;Earlier today, my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] presented [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHis] plan to catch any sneaky spies at court. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] has weakened the floorboards in strategic places to make sure a creaking noise is always heard when someone moves around during the night.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_2076;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName] is trying out [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHis] new plan to get rid of intruders. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] has been splashing soap on all of the floors to make it more hazardous to move around.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2076;Now if only I could get rid of this terrible headache.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2076;This is dangerous!;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_2077;As I entered the gates I was greeted by a large barking dog. My horse was frightened and started to rear. I was just about to draw my blade to slay the beast when I saw my [Root.GetSpymasterName], [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName], come running, shouting: "Bad dog! This is our friend that we're supposed to protect." The dog then stopped barking and rolled around placidly on its back.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_2077;There's litter and feathers all over the place and when you enter the dining hall you see a huge pelican standing on the table. When [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] sees my steaming face he tries to calm me down, introducing me to the new 'Pelican Guard'.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2077;Good dog!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2077;It bit me! Get rid of it!;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2077;It bit my sister! Get rid of it!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2078;[GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] presents a strange concoction to me. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] places a peg on my nose and forces me to drink the vile concoction while mumbling something that this will help keep away the forces that lurk in the shadows.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2078;Eugh! My mouth reeks of garlic.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2080;When I walk into the office of my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] I find [safety_measure_spymaster.GetHerHim] carving huge and sharp stakes which [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHe] tells me will help bring down any intruder that dares to trespass. The enthusiastic smile on [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName]'s face gives me an eerie feeling.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2080;If it keeps us safe...;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2080;This nonsense has to stop!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2081;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] told me [safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHe] had something exciting to show me. I was left unimpressed when it turned out to be a vial of ordinary water. [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] then told me that this 'blessed water' can drive away our enemies. The small donation demanded by the supplier had apparently already been taken care of.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2081;Expensive water.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2081;A great initiative!;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2081;This nonsense has to stop!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2083;I heard shouting down the corridor and when I came around the corner I see [spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] loudly arguing with my [Root.GetSpymasterName] [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName]. Clearly outraged, [spiritual.GetFirstName] explained to me that [safety_measure_spymaster.GetFirstName] tried to convince [spiritual.GetHerHim] to declare the entire building sacred ground.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2083;Enough of this!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2083;[safety_measure_spymaster.GetSheHeCap] was just joking. I hope you understand.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2083;Surely, for the correct sum this can be arranged?;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2071;[blackmailed_target.GetTitledFirstName] has brought up a grave problem [blackmailed_target.GetSheHe] has with your [GetSpymasterName] [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName]. [job_spymaster.GetFirstName] has been using the realm's spies to go snooping about in the personal quarters of [blackmailed_target.GetFirstName] for [job_spymaster.GetHerHis] own personal gain.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_2071;Remove [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] from the Council.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_2071;Remind [Root.job_spymaster.GetFirstName] to act in the shadows but take no direct actions.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_2071;Imply that I know secrets...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_2030;While walking down the corridor a local peasant runs up to me with panic in his eyes: 'I came here to ask for aid since some of my sheep got killed by wild animals but now I just need to get out of here. I've already paid a dozen fees and been stuck in different rooms for hours in supposed 'queues' but I saw no-one else there. Please help my poor soul!';x

EVTOPTA_ZE_6001;I'll see what I can do.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_6001;We don't need you.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_6001;I would not bother you with such petty assignments.;x
