EVTOPTA_ZE_12104;[From.GetSheHeCap] is hiding something.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12104;I should apologize.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12104;[From.GetSheHeCap] is so much fun!;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12104;That was a secret letter!;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12104;It wasn't mine to read.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12104;It's probably a boring letter anyway.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12104;I'm glad I found out!;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12104;I was meant to learn.;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12104;What a great day.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] didn't react well to my way of correcting [From.GetHerHis] behavior. I fear [From.GetSheHe] is even more suspicious towards me now.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] Seems regretful that [From.GetSheHe] disobeyed me. Hopefully It won't happen again.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12106;[From.GetFirstName] seems even more interested in the letter now that [From.GetSheHe] knows it's forbidden.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12106;After talking to [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] seems to understand the concept of privacy better.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12106;Worrying.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12106;There is hope for the child.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12106;Maybe I should have dealt with it differently.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12106;A step in the right direction.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12100_TOOLTIP1;Find something nasty.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12100_TOOLTIP2;Find a friend.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12080;I saw that the private chambers of [conscientious_events_char_1.GetFullName] were very messy. Papers, books and things lying around everywhere!;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12080;After supper, me and [conscientious_events_char_2.GetFirstName] were supposed to help do the dishes. But [conscientious_events_char_2.GetFirstName] hid the dirty dishes and wants to go play instead.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12080;It's getting late but I lost my new vest when I was playing somewhere. If i come back without it everyone will think I'm sloppy!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12080;I will sort it out for [conscientious_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12080;So much to do outside.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12080;I have to tell on [conscientious_events_char_2.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12080;No one will find out!;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080;I have to go look for it.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12080;I can explain when I get back.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080_TOOLTIP1;Becoming ill;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12080_TOOLTIP2;Successfull find;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12082;As I enter my chambers, all of the work I had done in my spare time seems to have been cleaned up and put back. Books are neatly set in alphabetical order and notes have been thrown away. [From.GetFullName] was apparently 'cleaning' earlier.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12082;After supper, me and [From.GetFirstName] were forced to do dishes. But I was clever and hid them, until [From.GetFirstName] told on me and now I have to do all of it.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12082;After supper, me and [From.GetFirstName] had to clean up. But we hid all the dishes where no one could see and now we have been playing all evening.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12082;I'll mess up [From.GetHerHis] chambers.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12082;Cleaning is not my virtue...;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12082;Unfair! I'll run away.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12082;Stupid dishes.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12082;We had so much fun together.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12084;[From.GetTitledName] didn't like that I was cleaning [From.GetHerHis] chambers, [From.GetSheHe] could not find important books. Now [From.GetSheHe] messed mine up and said I wasn't allowed back in [From.GetHersHis] anymore.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12084;[From.GetFirstName] ran away when I told on him. The others said I don't have to do all the work alone. But I was a good [Root.GetBoyGirl] for telling them.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12084;[From.GetFirstName] was angry with me, but we did finish all the work together. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] doesn't like me any more.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12084;I was out too long in the evening, and it hurts when I breathe. The adults say I have to rest a lot.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12084;Yes! I found my vest and no one will even know it was missing.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12084;Now I have to clean again.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12084;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a meanie and I will tell everyone!;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12084;I will do it myself.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12084;I can spend time reading.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12084;The grownups are happy.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12084;I feel terrible.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12084;Next time I will take my things with me.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12086;[From.GetFirstName] is quietly cleaning [From.GetHerHis] chambers after my episode in there. Seems like this is a very thorough child.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12086;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset with me and told everyone what I did.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12086;Maybe I shouldn't have.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12086;That little monster.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12090;It's bedtime but I can't find my favorite toy. I have it when I go to sleep.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12090;Food is on my plate, but steam is coming out of it. I wonder if it's safe to eat? [fussy_events_char_2.GetTitledName] is looking at me.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12090;I was invited to the servants' quarters to eat cake with them tonight. But just as I was going there, it started raining.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12090;I can't sleep without it!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12090;I'm a big [Root.GetBoyGirl] now.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12090;It's too hot.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12090;I should trust [fussy_events_char_2.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090;I can make it if I run.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12090;I don't want to get wet, I'll wait.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP1;Make it with no effort;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP2;Out in the cold too long;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy is missing and [From.GetSheHe] won't go to bed without it. I may have thrown it out today when I was tidying up.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] was a bit worried about not finding [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy, but seems to have settled down and is now sound asleep. ;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12092;At the table today, [From.GetFirstName] complained about the food being too hot without even touching it.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12092;[From.GetFirstName] was very happy at dinner today, eating with great appetite.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12092;I'll offer to buy a new one.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12092;Guess I have to go find it.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12092;One more step towards growing up.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12092;Touch the food to make sure.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12092;Let [From.GetHerHim] wait.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12092;That's nice.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] offered to get me a new toy. [From.GetSheHeCap] said we could go find something nice tomorrow.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] finally found my toy after looking for it everywhere. It was in the trash.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] reached over the table and touched my food with [From.GetHerHis] whole hand. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was not too hot to eat.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12094;[From.GetFirstName] seemed angry with me and told me to wait until I felt the food's temperature was just right. Now its cool enough.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12094;I ran very fast and I made it in time. We had lots of fun and the servants seem to like me.;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12094;I made it to the servants' quarters, but I got very wet. Then we had a good time and they felt sorry for me having to go out in the cold..;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12094;It's not the same, I want my toy!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12094;Ok then.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12094;It stinks!;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12094;Oh I thought I had lost it.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12094;But now [From.GetSheHe] touched it.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12094;I guess it's fine.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12094;But now some of it is too cold.;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12094;Alright, I'll eat the cold food.;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12094;Yum yum.;x
EVTOPTJ_ZE_12094;I don't feel so good.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12096;My offer to purchase a new toy was rejected by [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is upset I would even suggest such a thing.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get a new toy the next day and finally settled down.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12096;I found the toy [From.GetFirstName] was crying about after going through the trash. But now [From.GetSheHe] is not satisfied because it smells.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] finally fell asleep after I found [From.GetHerHis] toy.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12096;No matter what I do or avoid doing, there seems to be no good way to make [From.GetFirstName] relax. [From.GetSheHeCap] won't eat at all now and I have no more energy to deal with it.;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12096;[From.GetFirstName] finally decided to eat [From.GetHerHis] food.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12096;There is no pleasing this child.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12096;What a relief.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12096;It stinks!;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12096;Oh I thought I had lost it.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12096;Hopeless.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12096;Peace at last.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12110;[idolizer_events_char_1.GetTitledName] is so kind to me. And [idolizer_events_char_1.GetSheHe] seems to know so much about everything.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12110;Spending time with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is great. We get along so well. Even when we do chores together time goes by so fast.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12110;I have been praying with the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] for a while and some of the other people in the temple are getting ready to leave.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12110;I'll write [idolizer_events_char_1.GetHerHim] a song!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12110;I should tell the courtiers that I like it here.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12110;Everything is better when [idolizer_events_char_2.GetSheHe] is around.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12110;I will stay friends with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetHerHim] forever.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12110;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will notice my dedication.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12110;I can collect alms to keep for myself.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] has written a song in my honor. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] wants me to know that I'm the best person in the world.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] told me that everyone is so kind here. [From.GetSheHeCap] would make sure everyone knew how grateful [From.GetSheHe] is.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] really loves spending time with me. I make [From.GetHerHis] days so much better.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12112;[From.GetFirstName] and I always get along well and now [From.GetSheHe] told me that we should stay friends forever.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12112;I can tell stories to impress [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12112;I'm just a responsible adult.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12112;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a joy to have around.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12112;I'll kiss [From.GetFirstName] on the cheek.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12112;[From.GetSheHeCap] is kind. But I don't feel that way.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12112;I can always count on [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] was very happy for my gesture. [From.GetSheHeCap] agreed that [From.GetHerHis] exceptional personality and skill is worthy of songs and praise. Now the others could see [From.GetHerHim] for what [From.GetSheHe] is.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] was humbled by the song I had written. But [From.GetSheHeCap] wanted to make a point of being just an ordinary person, and that I shouldn't give [From.GetHerHim] more credit than [From.GetSheHe] deserves.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12114;[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12114;After a whole night of religious ritual, I started getting hungry and my mind wandered. Maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is happy with the time I spent here.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12114;I wish [From.GetSheHe] was my [From.GetFatherMother].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12114;What a dufus.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12114;What a hero.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12114;Grownups can do anything.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12114;[From.GetSheHeCap] is the best.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12114;This is not what I meant.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12114;I shouldn't have said anything.;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12114;I am being tested, I must stay here.;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12114;I can't miss fencing practice.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] is no less impressed by me now. It seems I'm quite the idol for [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] seems to have lost [From.GetHerHis] overwhelming affection for me. For better or worse, it's good to learn moderation. I might not be that special after all.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12116;[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12116;I hope I'm a good influence on [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12116;The older they get...;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12116;What a sweetie.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12116;I don't like [From.GetHerHim] anyway...;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_12070;It has been a long day outside and [playful_events_char_1.GetTitledName] says it is time to head back home. [playful_events_char_1.GetSheHeCap] is carrying some heavy bags, maybe this time I can beat [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12070;It's late at night and I get out of bed to use the chamberpot. [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] starts calling my name and I see a man hiding under the dining table. He notices me and whispers 'psst, come over here'. ;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12070;Today I had to help out digging in the garden, but gardening is boring. The gardener is boring too, but maybe?;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12070;Race me!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12070;Help [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim] with the bags.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12070;Hide with the man.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12070;Answer [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070;I can tickle her.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12070;Hard work is good for discipline.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP1;Gardener is tickly.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP2;Gardener doesn't appreciate tickling.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12072;After I told [From.GetFirstName] it was time to head on home, [From.GetSheHe] looked at me with a grin on [From.GetHerHis] face and told me to race [From.GetHerHim] home, leaving me to carry everything on my own.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12072;After some hours running errands I was heading back home with [From.GetFirstName]. Just as I told [From.GetHerHim] we were going home [From.GetSheHe] took one of the bags to help carry it without me even asking.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12072;[playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] stops calling for me after a while. The man says 'I bet you this gold coin you can't hold your breath until I'm outside'.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12072;[From.GetFirstName] was not in [From.GetHerHis] his room and I was starting to get worried. When [From.GetSheHe] finally answered I found [From.GetHerHim] staring at a burglar who was trying to hide from me.;x

EVTOPTF_ZE_12072;Guards!;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] chased and caught me. Maybe next time I can run fast enough.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] was not happy that I ran away from [From.GetHerHim] without helping. Now I have to stay indoors all day tomorrow.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12074;Before I knew it, the man was running out through the door. He didn't even look back once.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] seemed shocked when [From.GetSheHe] found me. The guards came and took the man hiding under the table. They said he was a bad man and I should stay away from strangers.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12074;We had some time to play before we finished all of the work.;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12074;She was not ticklish, and now she is telling everybody what a hassle I am to have around.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12074;[From.GetSheHeCap] is so fast.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12074;[From.GetFirstName] is a cheater.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12074;Everyone here is so boring.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12074;I win, easy.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12074;I wonder who that was.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12074;Nothing has to be boring.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12074;She is stupid.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12076;[From.GetFirstName] never seems to be grumpy, always playing without a care in the world.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12076;[From.GetFirstName] was a little bit let down that I caught up with [From.GetHerHim] and even called me a cheater. Not always winning is a good thing for children to learn.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12076;I heard noises in the middle of the night and when I got up to check on [From.GetFirstName] I had to call out several times. Then [From.GetSheHe] finally answered and I found [From.GetHerHim] under the dining table with a burglar. The guards made quick work of the burglar.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12076;It will change.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12076;[From.GetSheHeCap] will thank me later.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12076;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I found [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12060;[indolent_events_char_1.GetFirstName] has come to get my help, today we are going to cut down some trees. Very hard work [indolent_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12060;I've been asked to go fetch some supplies at the market but it's a long walk. [indolent_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is already going to get other things.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12060;I'm reading a poetry book in my room but the weather is so nice outside. There are some children playing in the sun.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12060;Ouch, my stomach hurts suddenly.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12060;I'll cut down the biggest one.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12060;Pay [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim] to get your groceries.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12060;Join up with [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12060;Go see what they are doing.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12060;Keep on reading.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12062;As soon as I came to pick up [From.GetFirstName] to help me out cutting down some trees [From.GetSheHe] starts complaining. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has a nasty stomach ache.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12062;Today me and [From.GetFirstName] spent some time outside cutting down trees, no complaints from the young [From.GetBoyGirl] and work was finished early.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to get some things for [From.GetHerHim] at the market as I am already going there. [From.GetSheHeCap] is even paying me;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] came with me to the market today, we both had to go get some groceries and had time to talk a lot.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12062;Indolent brat, I'll show [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12062;Maybe there's something wrong with [From.GetHerHim]?;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12062;Job well done.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12062;Very easy money.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12062;I refuse!;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12062;[From.GetFirstName] is so kind.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] spanked me when I complained about my stomach ache. Then [From.GetSheHe] grabbed my arm and told me we were going outside.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] seemed worried and brought me some tea. I have to drink it to get better. I also got some freshly baked bread for when I feel better.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get everything if I gave [From.GetHerHim] some extra coin. I should stay in my room so no one knows I'm still home. I've got some time to spend while I'm in here.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12064;[From.GetFirstName] didn't want to help me out. [From.GetSheHeCap] is already heading out.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12064;The other children are chasing each other, lots of running and jumping.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12064;Now I can't use my arm to cut trees.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12064;I'm coming, I'm coming!;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12064;Oh tea and fresh bread!;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12064;Maybe I should help [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12064;I could use a nap right now.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12064;Read a book about money.;x
EVTOPTG_ZE_12064;I guess I'll have to go then.;x
EVTOPTH_ZE_12064;Maybe I'll just watch them.;x
EVTOPTI_ZE_12064;I'll join in.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12066;[From.GetFirstName] apparently has pains in [From.GetHerHis] arm now after I grabbed it and 'cannot use it to cut trees'.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12066;[From.GetFirstName] was happy when I brought [From.GetHerHim] some tea and bread. [From.GetSheHe] should recover soon.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12066;Some motivation can give good results, apparently the pain is all gone now after some convincing and [From.GetFirstName] will come join me.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12066;Hopeless...;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12066;Poor child.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12066;Suddenly better, that's great.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12050;[brooding_events_char_1.GetTitledName] promised to take me riding today, but when I came to see [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim] [brooding_events_char_1.GetSheHe] was drunk and half asleep.;x

EVTOPTF_ZE_12050;Noone can know I'm here.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12052;Sure, I forgot about my promise to take [From.GetFirstName] riding. But now... Now [From.GetSheHe] poured water on me when I was resting. I only had a little bit to drink, and and and I am the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12052;I woke up feeling a bit hung over, and it's already evening. I vaguely recall [From.GetFirstName] looking at me before I fell asleep. I think I had plans with [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12052;[From.GetFirstName] wanted to learn to whistle. After trying for a while [From.GetSheHe] asked me 'How come you can do it?';x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12052;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to teach [From.GetHerHim] how to whistle. I must have inspired [From.GetHerHim], now [From.GetSheHe] has been at it for hours.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12052;I'll show [From.GetHerHim]!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12052;I'm sorry [From.GetFirstName].;x

EVTOPTE_ZE_12052;Not everyone can do it.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12052;[From.GetSheHeCap]'ll get it right soon.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] tried to say something, but I couldn't hear what it was. Then [From.GetSheHeCap] got up and raised [From.GetHerHis] fist at me before stumbling and falling. Now [From.GetSheHe] is snoring.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] is quietly mumbling some words and rubbing [From.GetHerHis] face. 'Sorry, I'm sorry' [From.GetSheHe] says..;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] told me that whistling is easy. That I can do it if I try. But I've tried many times already.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12054;[From.GetFirstName] said that not everyone learns to whistle. Some can never do it.;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12054;The bullies all scatter when I tell them to stop. The small child looks at me and asks for food without mentioning the others and what they did. Is this how commoners live?;x

EVTDESCA_ZE_12056;I have a bad headache, and my episode with [From.GetFirstName] is slowly coming back to me. There is no excuse for my behavior. What's worse is that I even got lectured by a child.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12056;Waking up in my room, I seem to be missing some money. I vaguely remember [From.GetFirstName] being here. Wasn't [From.GetSheHe]?;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12056;The last thing I remember before falling asleep is apologizing to [From.GetFirstName]. It seems my apology was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted.;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12056;I wake up, and [From.GetFirstName] is still by my side. [From.GetSheHeCap] has brought me some water to drink, and covered me with a blanket. I don't deserve treatment like this. But if [From.GetSheHe] sees good in me...;x
EVTDESCE_ZE_12056;[From.GetFirstName] seems a bit frustrated by [From.GetHerHis] failed attempts. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't seem to respond well to my encouraging words.;x
EVTDESCF_ZE_12056;[From.GetFirstName] went back to [From.GetHerHis] room to do other things now.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12056;I have seen better days.;x

EVTOPTC_ZE_12056;I'm in a sad state.;x

EVTOPTE_ZE_12056;Many things seem to trouble this child.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12056;I'm glad [From.GetSheHe] doesn't dwell too much on these things.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12040;[willful_events_char_1.GetFirstName] is frowning at me. 'Waste of time. It will never fit, you've grown out of it.' [willful_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says. But it's my favorite hat!;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12040;I'm out playing with [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] and we're close to the abandoned haunted house, we're not supposed to go there and [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is looking frightened.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12040;I've been out fishing for hours. I still haven't caught a fish as big as that servant's child got yesterday.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12040;It will fit if you help me.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12040;Give the hat to someone younger.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12040;Go inside.;x

EVTOPTF_ZE_12040;Go home.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP1;Catch something.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP2;Waste time.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12042;[From.GetFirstName] insists that I help [From.GetHerHim] get an old hat to fit. A very futile task as [From.GetSheHe]'s too big for it now as I've already told [From.GetHerHim] several times.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12042;[From.GetFirstName] really wants to go inside the scary haunted house. It looks like it's dangerous and we have been told not to go near it.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12042;No child tells me what to do.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12042;Give in to demands.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12042;I don't want to go in there.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12042;I can do this.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12044;[From.GetFirstName] hit me over the head for not listening to [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12044;[From.GetFirstName] says we have to go back now, and if we don't [From.GetSheHe] will tell on me.;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12044;After a few more hours, I finally feel something bite. It's a huge fish, probably the biggest fish in [Root.Capital.GetName].;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12044;I'm just about to give up, but then it happened. I caught a fish, but it's not very big.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12044;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s a meanie!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12044;Someone else can make it fit.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12044;Come, or I'll say it was your idea.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12044;You're right.;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_12044;They will tell stories of today.;x
EVTOPTF_ZE_12044;At least I tried.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I'm mean for not helping. [From.GetSheHeCap] even stuck [From.GetHerHis] tongue out at me.;x
EVTDESCB_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] will get someone else to help [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] still wants to go, and will lie and say it was my idea unless I go with [From.GetHerHim].;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_12046;[From.GetFirstName] said I was right and we went back home, away from the scary house.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_12046;Well [From.GetSheHe]'s stupid.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_12046;At least [From.GetSheHe] knows what [From.GetSheHe] wants.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_12046;I'm so angry!;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_12046;Don't mess with [Root.GetFirstName].;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_13700;I wake up in the middle of the night, my heart racing and my whole body is feeling strange. What was I really dreaming about?;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_13700;That farmer [Root.GetBoyGirl] I met earlier.;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13700;[lustful_target.GetFirstName], kissing me.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13700;Whatever it was is not important.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13700;I should just try to get to sleep.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_13701;Oh it's just something about [Root.GetHerHim] that I can't get off my mind. [Root.GetHerHisCap] hair, the way [Root.GetSheHe] moved. I'm getting all worked up just thinking about [Root.GetHerHim] again.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_13701;What would it be like to hold [Root.GetHerHim]?;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13701;[Root.GetSheHeCap] is the one for me.;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_13701;If I see [Root.GetHerHim] again we'll have some fun.;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13701;I shouldn't. It's a sin.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_13702;[lustful_target.GetHerHisCap] lips touching mine. My hands, touching [lustful_target.GetHerHim] gently. I wonder if [lustful_target.GetFirstName] feels the same way about me?;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_13702;I will save myself for [lustful_target.GetHerHim].;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_13702;[lustful_target.GetSheHeCap] gets me all excited.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_13703;These kind of thoughts have been distracting me lately. I don't find them very interesting and they are disturbing my sleep.;x

EVTOPTB_ZE_13703;Maybe it will change with time.;x
EVTDESCA_ZE_13704;[From.GetFirstName] has been looking at me in a new way lately. Giggling whenever I talk to [From.GetHerHim], laughing at things that are not meant to be funny.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_13704;It seems as [From.GetSheHe] is infatuated with me...;x
