EVTDESC_ZE_22300;While passing judgement onto criminals from the safety of your throne, a young noble is brought before you. You quickly come to the conclusion that the man is indeed guilty. Condemning him might not be the wisest choice, as he is of noble birth. If you were to pardon the man he might prove himself useful to you, as he would be in your debt.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22300;Release him! Now, do not forget what I did for you...;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22300;Being of noble birth means nothing. To the dungeons with him!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22400;During a particularly heated argument in the council, [target_saved_voter.GetTitledFirstName] stepped in as you were about to make a fool out of yourself. [target_saved_voter.GetSheHeCap] was able to argue for your point, not only saving your face but also winning the argument for you! It is obvious that [target_saved_voter.GetFirstName]'s smooth talking was the sole reason for your success, and denying that fact would likely paint you in a bad light.;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22400;Thank you! I do truly owe you in return!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22400;Bah! I would have won that argument by myself!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22410;During a particularly heated argument in the council, you stepped in as [From.GetBestName] was making a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself]. You managed to soothe the debaters and win the argument for [From.GetHerHim]. This turned out to be a great move on your part, as [From.GetSheHe] now feels indebted to you!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22410;Now, when to call in the favor...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22420;During a particularly heated argument in the council, you stepped in as [From.GetBestName] was making a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself]. You managed to soothe the debaters and win the argument for [From.GetHerHim]. Though this only infuriated [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] wanted to win the argument by [From.GetHerHis] own means! Throwing a tantrum like this has publicly shamed [From.GetFirstName].;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22420;Ingratitude is the world's reward.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22500;As the council meeting ends, [target_pious_voter.GetTitledFirstName] pulls you to the side. [target_pious_voter.GetSheHeCap] talks to you at length about the need to respect the authority of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] when making decisions in the council. Apparently the council is in agreement on you having neglected to do so, but fortunately [target_pious_voter.GetFirstName] offers to help you!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22500;You would do that for me? I am in your debt!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22500;No, there is no place for [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] in politics!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22510;The council agreed that [From.GetBestName] had been acting in a very impious way, ignoring many wisdoms of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Being a pious [Root.GetManWoman] you decided to help [From.GetHerHim] not repeat the same mistakes. [From.GetFirstName] was very grateful for this help, and told you that [From.GetSheHe] was in your debt!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22510;Excellent, I can make use of this favor.;x

Though, [From.GetFirstName] was infuriated by what [From.GetSheHe] assumed to be you trying to trick [From.GetHerHim]!;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22520;No better than a heretic...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22600;Word has reached you of a [target_foreign_voter.GetJobTitle] in a foreign realm who is of masterful skill and handles [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHis] tasks with ease. Seeing as your own abilities are often doubted by the rest of the Council, perhaps you should write a letter to this '[target_foreign_voter.GetBestName]' and ask for [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHis] advice?;x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22600;Yes, I will write [target_foreign_voter.GetHerHim]!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22600;No, why bother...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22610;To the masterful [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI am [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetJobTitle] of [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].\nYour skill as a [Root.GetJobTitle] on the Council of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is known far and wide.

EVTOPTA_ZE_22610;A touching request, I will help you!;x

EVTDESC_ZE_22620;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI agree to lend you advice on how to serve on the Council more effectively.

EVTOPTA_ZE_22620;Truly a great [From.GetManWoman]!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22630;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nDo you really think I would convey my secrets to you? You are a pathetic [From.GetJobTitle] and I do not see that changing soon!\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22630;I was foolish to ask...;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22630;Why the...! [From.GetSheHeCap] dares to insult me when I ask for help?;x
EVTOPTC_ZE_22630;Perhaps some money will change [From.GetHerHis] tone?;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22640;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nKnow that I will never forget what you did for me! Please do not hesitate to ask if there is anything I can do for you, and know I will treat you like the dearest of friends.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22640;Perfect!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22650;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I asked out of curiosity and not malice, but even so I apologize for what I did.\nSincerely,\n\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22650;Perhaps I was too harsh in my response...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22660;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYou dare to refuse me help? Know that I will not soon forget this insult to my honor.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22660;Truly a fool...;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22670;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI excuse my forward request. Perhaps some gold would make you reconsider my offer?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22670;Well, when you put it like that!;x
EVTOPTB_ZE_22670;No amount of gold will help your cause.;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22680;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI excuse my previous behavior! Along with this letter I have enclosed a book which treatise my own experience as a [From.GetJobTitle], I hope its contents will serve you well!\n\nRegards,\n[From.GetTitledName];x
EVTOPTA_ZE_22680;I knew some gold would loosen [From.GetHerHis] tongue!;x
EVTDESC_ZE_22690;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nDid you really think that I could be bought? Take your money back and leave me be, you will never partake of my secrets!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];x

EVTDESC_ZE_23000;Being on your liege's council is not always easy. You have a huge amount of work that needs attention and there is so much to do. The list seems endless.

EVTDESC_ZE_23005;Every ruler needs to go out and meet the peasants in person from time to time. Just to make sure that they know you still exist if nothing else.
